Breakthrough T1D-supported research has been highlighted at this annual event since the organization started funding research in the 1970s. This year, researchers presented more than 180 studies\u2014with Breakthrough T1D funding at present or in the past\u2014that are paving the way for more life-changing T1D breakthroughs.\n\"As we drive toward cures, Breakthrough T1D connects and funds the brightest minds to help accelerate cures, advance treatments, and improve access to care for those who live with type 1 diabetes all over the world. The research presented at the ADA Scientific Sessions demonstrates the incredible progress being made in the space,\" said Aaron Kowalski, Ph.D., Breakthrough T1D CEO. \"Breakthrough T1D is thrilled to lead and support the innovation and cutting-edge research that are accelerating life-changing breakthroughs for people with type 1 diabetes.\"\nA key highlight of this year's conference was the presentation and publication of the first-ever international consensus guidance for monitoring early-stage T1D. Convened and led by Breakthrough T1D, the guidance was developed in conjunction with over 60 international experts representing 10 countries and endorsed by 11 national and international organizations and societies. It provides guidance for monitoring children, adolescents, and adults who test positive for T1D autoantibodies, along with recommended frequencies of monitoring and actions for health care professionals when risk of progression towards symptomatic T1D is high. Notably, the guidance also includes recommendations for educational and psychosocial support.\n\"Early detection of type 1 diabetes is a priority for Breakthrough T1D, and the development of this guidance provides clarity and next steps for individuals, caregivers, and health care professionals following a positive autoantibody test,\" said Sanjoy Dutta, Ph.D., Breakthrough T1D chief scientific officer. \"Clear monitoring guidance create a pathway to realize the benefits of early detection of T1D, including significant reduction in incidences of diabetic ketoacidosis at diagnosis, opportunities to participate in clinical trials, access to therapies that can delay onset of T1D, and time to prepare for a diagnosis. The ADA Scientific Sessions was an ideal place to present this guidance to the broader T1D scientific and professional communities.\"\nOther highlights from the sessions include:\nVertex Pharmaceuticals gave a highly anticipated update on the phase I/II clinical trial of VX-880, their stem cell-derived islet cell therapy. Today, all participants who have had the therapy for at least five months have an HbA1c below 7.0% and are above target time-in-range, 11 of 12 participants have reduced or eliminated the need for external insulin, and all three individuals who received the therapy at least 12 months ago have eliminated hypoglycemic events and are fully off external insulin\u2014meeting the primary and secondary endpoints. This research was made possible by years of funding by Breakthrough T1D and the T1D Fund to Doug Melton, Ph.D., and Semma Therapeutics\u2014a biotech company founded by Melton to develop a stem cell-derived islet therapy for T1D\u2014which was acquired by Vertex Pharmaceuticals.\nKevan Herold, M.D., presented a secondary analysis of the phase III PROTECT clinical trial. In October 2023, Tzield\u2122 (teplizumab-mzwv) showed that it can slow the loss of beta cells and preserve beta cell function in newly diagnosed (stage 3 T1D) children and adolescents ages eight to 17. This analysis demonstrated that, in addition to slowing down the loss of beta cells in new-onset T1D, Tzield can decrease insulin dose and improve time-in-range. This reinforces our commitment to supporting therapies that preserve beta cells at onset, which is important for the prevention of complications and improvement in new-onset clinical factors. Dr. Herold has been supported by Breakthrough T1D since the late 1980s. In his research, he showed that he could prevent autoimmune diabetes with an immune-modifying antibody (which later, became a humanized version, teplizumap) and was the lead on the clinical trial that demonstrated that teplizumab could delay the onset of T1D in people almost certain to develop the disease. In November 2022, teplizumab was approved by the FDA to delay the onset of the disease in at-risk individuals eight and older.\nIn a Breakthrough T1D-funded study, Peter Calhoun, Ph.D., gave a fascinating talk on how continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) can predict who will move onto Stage 3 T1D earlier. He took a dataset from five screening programs\u2014TrialNet, ASK (Autoimmunity Screening for Kids), DAISY (Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young), DIPP (Type 1 Diabetes Prediction and Prevention), and BDR (Belgium Diabetes Registry)\u2014and was able to show that incorporating CGM metrics into individual characteristics had the best predictive performance to classify individuals of the impending clinical onset of T1D.\nMore information about Breakthrough T1D-funded research and presentations can be found on Breakthrough T1D's website.\nAbout Breakthrough T1D, Formerly JDRF As the leading global type 1 diabetes research and advocacy organization, Breakthrough T1D helps make everyday life with type 1 diabetes better while driving toward cures. We do this by investing in the most promising research, advocating for progress by working with government to address issues that impact the T1D community, and helping educate and empower individuals facing this condition.\nAbout Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) T1D is an autoimmune condition that causes the pancreas to make very little insulin or none at all. This leads to dependence on insulin therapy and the risk of short and long-term complications, which can include highs and lows in blood sugar; damage to the kidneys, eyes, nerves, and heart; and even death. Globally, it impacts nearly 9 million people. Many believe T1D is only diagnosed in childhood and adolescence, but diagnosis in adulthood is common and accounts for nearly 50% of all T1D diagnoses. The onset of T1D has nothing to do with diet or lifestyle. While its causes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved. There is currently no cure for T1D.\nContact:Casey Fielder509-651-0087media@BreakthroughT1D.org\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/breakthrough-t1d-funded-research-featured-at-american-diabetes-association-84th-scientific-sessions-302182379.html\nSOURCE JDRF International", "rights": "yahoo.com", "rank": 36, "topic": "news", "country": "US", "language": "en", "authors": "PR Newswire", "media": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/prnewswire.com/f32b77fb7ffc641a84f4395455f01e62", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@YahooFinance", "_score": 22.267101, "_id": "ecfcccba6f42c21cb6633fdb1f0c63ae"}, {"title": "IQVIA's SmartSolve\u00ae eQMS Wins 2024 MedTech Breakthrough Award \"Best Use of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare\"", "author": "Business Wire", "published_date": "2024-06-25 12:00:00", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iqvia-smartsolve-eqms-wins-2024-120000871.html", "clean_url": "yahoo.com", "excerpt": "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., June 25, 2024--IQVIA\u2122 (NYSE:IQV), a leading global provider of AI-powered analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services to the life sciences industry,\u2026", "summary": "RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., June 25, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--IQVIA\u2122 (NYSE:IQV), a leading global provider of AI-powered analytics, technology solutions, and clinical research services to the life sciences industry, today announced that the IQVIA SmartSolve Enterprise Quality Management System (eQMS) platform has been selected as the winner of the \"Best Use of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare\" award in the 8th Annual MedTech Breakthrough Awards.\nSmartSolve eQMS is part of IQVIA's suite of purpose-built safety, regulatory and quality technologies, providing a single source of truth for quality compliance.

diabetes.\nThe study, published in the journalDiabetes, found that the chemical BPA used to make food and drink packages, including plastic water bottles, can reduce sensitivity to the hormone insulin which regulates the body's sugar metabolism.\nThe findings, to be presented at the 2024 Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association, call for the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reconsider the safe limits for exposure to BPA in bottles and food containers.\nPrevious studies have already shown that the chemical Bisphenol A used to make plastic and epoxy resins could disrupt hormones in humans.\nWhile research has linked BPA to diabetes, no previous study has directly assessed if administration of this chemical to humans increases this risk in adults.\n'The findings are the first to provide evidence that BPA administration may increase type 2 diabetes risk,' scientists from the California Polytechnic State University said in a statement.\nIn the study, researchers randomly assigned 40 healthy adults to either receive a placebo, or about 50 micrograms per kg of their body weight of BPA daily.\nThis BPA dose is the amount currently classified as safe by the EPA.\nThose who were administered BPA were less responsive to insulin after 4 days, while this change was noticed in the placebo group participants.\n'These results suggest that maybe the US EPA safe dose should be reconsidered and that healthcare providers could suggest these changes to patients,' researchers warned.\nReducing BPA exposure by approaches like using stainless steel or glass bottles and BPA-free cans can lower diabetes risk, they said.\nPlastic bottles are ubiquitous across the world due to their convenience but a growing body of research is raising concerns about the health impacts of their chemical components.\nAnother study, published recently in the journal Eco-Environment & Health, found that sunlight-exposed plastic water bottles could release harmful chemicals.\nThis research assessed the volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, released from six types of plastic water bottles subjected to sunlight.\nIt found that some types of bottles release highly toxic organic compounds, including known cancer-causing chemicals like n-hexadecane, highlighting serious health risks.\nThese findings call for stricter industry regulations to ensure reduction in

professionals to track and treat people who test positive for diabetes autoantibodies\nGuidance was convened by Breakthrough T1D and developed in partnership with the Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes (ATTD), the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE), the American Diabetes Association (ADA), the Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists (ADCES), the Endocrine Society, the Australian Diabetes Society (ADS), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD), the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), and 60 experts from 11 countries on 4 continents\nNEW YORK, June 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Breakthrough T1D (formerly JDRF), the leading global type 1 diabetes (T1D) research and advocacy organization, together with international diabetes experts from around the world, today announced the development of the first international consensus guidance titled \"Consensus Guidance for Monitoring Persons with Islet Autoantibody-Positive Pre-Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes,\" for monitoring people who test positive for one or more islet autoantibody, putting them at risk of developing T1D. The consensus guidance was published today online ahead of print in Diabetes Care and Diabetologia and released today during the American Diabetes Association's 84th Scientific Sessions in Orlando, Florida.\nThe detection of autoantibodies is currently the earliest indicator that an individual may develop T1D in their lifetime. The guidance \u2013 designed for non-specialists, primary care providers, and pediatricians who are most likely to care for individuals who test positive \u2013 defines how these patients should be monitored. Studies show that monitoring following T1D screening can significantly reduce the incidence of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) at diagnosis and allows those in early stages of T1D to receive disease management guidance, potentially delay the onset through disease-modifying therapy, and/or to enroll in clinical trials assessing effectiveness of novel therapies.1\n\"Depending on where they live, up to 70% of people with T1D experience DKA at diagnosis, underscoring the importance of screening and clear and concise monitoring guidance,\" said Anastasia Albanese-O'Neill, PhD, AVP of Community Screening and Clinical Trial Education, Breakthrough T1D. \"Early detection and T1D monitoring are key priority areas for Breakthrough T1D as we drive toward cures and continue to advance therapies that can change the course of T1D for those who face it. We recognized that there was a clinical gap following T1D screening, so we led the charge to convene a panel to develop monitoring guidance that would address this need,\" she said. \"It is a monumental achievement to have consensus among leading international experts in T1D for monitoring people of all ages. It is vital that we continue to build momentum toward a future without T1D by investing in ongoing research and encouraging expanded access and participation in screening. The time is now.\"\nScreening for T1D autoantibodies is not yet commonplace, although research has shown that T1D can be detected before the presence of symptoms or clinical diagnosis, and there is increasing consensus and evidence that those with a family history of T1D should be screened. The new expert clinical advice underscores the importance of accurately diagnosing the current stage of T1D and providing ongoing monitoring for disease progression that is tailored to the needs of the affected individuals and their families. Additionally, for the first time, the guidance outlines how to provide psychosocial and educational support for individuals and families.\nKnowing one's autoantibody status through screening provides an opportunity to enroll in research studies that help advance the science to identify factors that could delay and ultimately prevent T1D. Research plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying mechanisms of T1D development, including the role of genetics, autoimmunity, and environmental factors. This understanding is essential for the development of effective prevention strategies and disease-modifying therapies.\n\"More people at risk of T1D need to be screened, and for those who test positive, we now have a clearer path to delaying the onset of diabetes or preventing complications like ketoacidosis,\" said Moshe Phillip, MD, Chair of the Consensus Monitoring Guidance and Director, Institute for Endocrinology and Diabetes at the National Center for Childhood Diabetes, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, and Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel. \"The new guidance should encourage more primary care providers to offer screening to their patients \u2013 especially those with a family history of T1D \u2013 so we can identify those at risk earlier and improve outcomes for those who go on to develop T1D.\"\nPrimary care providers \u2013 who are experienced in screening for a variety of conditions \u2013 play a key role in screening and early-stage monitoring of children and adults who are positive for T1D autoantibodies. Education programs could help more primary care providers learn staging criteria, which are still relatively new and not yet widely known. As some individuals progress to T1D rapidly and others may take decades to develop symptoms, monitoring recommendations vary, and primary care providers can partner with specialists when care needs shift over time.\n\"Preventing, optimizing management, and finding cures for T1D will require commitment and actions by multiple healthcare partners, including primary care providers, specialists, and healthcare educators,\" said Linda A DiMeglio, MD, MPH Vice-Chair of the Consensus Monitoring Guidance Working Group and Division Chief for Pediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology in the Department of Pediatrics, Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana. \"Providing these partners with evidence-based guidance for early-stage monitoring and management for individuals identified with islet autoantibodies is an important step forward toward improved outcomes.\"\nThe consensus process was initiated by Breakthrough T1D during the 16th International Conference on Advanced Technologies & Treatments for Diabetes in Berlin, Germany. The initial working group included 61 internationally recognized experts in early-stage T1D diagnosis and care. In the coming weeks, Breakthrough T1D will launch a public education campaign to encourage more people to talk to their doctors about T1D screening. Screening can help identify early-stage T1D before symptoms occur so that a monitoring plan can be developed with your healthcare provider.

We do this by investing in the most promising research, advocating for progress by working with government to address issues that impact the T1D community, and helping educate and empower individuals facing this condition.\nAbout Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) T1D is an autoimmune condition that causes the pancreas to make very little insulin or none at all. This leads to dependence on insulin therapy and the risk of short and long-term complications, which can include highs and lows in blood sugar; damage to the kidneys, eyes, nerves, and heart; and even death. Globally, it impacts nearly 9 million people. Many believe T1D is only diagnosed in childhood and adolescence, but diagnosis in adulthood is common and accounts for nearly 50% of all T1D diagnoses. The onset of T1D has nothing to do with diet or lifestyle. While its causes are not yet entirely understood, scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers are involved. There is currently no cure for T1D.\nReference\nBesser REJ, Bell KJ, Couper JJ, Ziegler A, Wherrett DK, Knip M, et al.

ESM3 generated a new Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), a process that would take 500 million years of evolution to occur naturally. This milestone generative AI model allows interactive prompting to create proteins, empowering scientists to advance applications from drug discovery, and materials science, to carbon capture.\nThe founding team at EvolutionaryScale and behind ESM3 are pioneers in applying AI to biology, building what is widely considered to be the first transformer language model for proteins ESM1. The ESM models have empowered groundbreaking scientific research, including a breakthrough in protein folding that helped reveal the structures of hundreds of millions of metagenomic proteins; the models have been used by scientists across the world to model and understand proteins.\nEvolutionaryScale described ESM3 today in a scientific preprint and released an open version of the model for scientific researchers (links below).\nThe Frontier Language Model for Biology\nESM3 was trained with 1 trillion teraflops \u2013 more compute than any other known model in biology \u2013 on a dataset of 2.78 billion proteins across the Earth's natural diversity. It is the first generative model for biology that simultaneously reasons over the sequence, structure and function of proteins. This enables scientists to understand and create new proteins, making biology programmable.\n\"ESM3 takes a step toward a future of biology where AI is a tool to engineer from first principles, the way we engineer structures, machines, and microchips, and write computer programs,\" said EvolutionaryScale co-founder and chief scientist, Alexander Rives. \"We've been working on this for a long time, and we're excited to share it with the scientific community and see what they do with it.\"\nWith this capability, the model has the potential to accelerate discovery across a broad range of applications, ranging from the development of new cancer treatments to creating proteins that could help capture carbon.\nSimulating 500 Million Years of Evolution with a Language Model\nPrompted through a chain of thought to reason over possible sequences and structures of GFP, ESM3 stepped across 500 million years of evolution to create a new fluorescent protein. GFP is one of the most beautiful and unique proteins in nature, responsible for the glowing of jellyfish and the vivid fluorescent colors of coral. It is the only protein that emits light, and the biological mechanism for this is unique \u2013 it is a protein that transforms itself forming a light emitting chromophore out of its own atoms.\nGFP has become an important tool in molecular biology, helping scientists to see molecules inside cells. The mechanism that powers this phenomenon is incredibly complex, and generating a variant this distant by computational or experimental laboratory techniques has not been scientifically documented. New fluorescent proteins this distant from known ones have only been found through the discovery of new GFPs in the natural world. Our analysis suggests that under natural evolution it could take more than 500 million years for a protein this different to evolve.\nESM3: A Tool for Scientists\nESM3's success in generating a new GFP underscores the model's potential for advancements in biological research and life sciences.\nEvolutionaryScale will be opening an API for closed beta today and code and weights are available for a small open version of ESM3 for non-commercial use. EvolutionaryScale is also collaborating with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and NVIDIA to accelerate applications from drug discovery to synthetic biology with AI.\nBy working with AWS, Evolutionary Scale is making the full ESM3 model family easily accessible to hundreds of thousands of researchers around the world and nine out of the top ten global pharma companies, who already use AWS's generative AI and health services \u2014 Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Bedrock, and AWS HealthOmics. This move will make it easier for researchers to fine-tune the ESM3 models using their own proprietary data securely, and at scale.\nAll versions of ESM3 will be optimized for training and inference performance through the company's ongoing collaboration with NVIDIA, including NVIDIA BioNeMo NIMs to accelerate runtime performance and support through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software license and at ai.nvidia.com.\nCloses More Than $142 Million in Seed Funding\nEvolutionaryScale also announced a seed round of more than $142 million, led by Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, and Lux Capital, with participation from Amazon, NVentures (NVIDIA's venture capital arm) and angel investors. Funding will be used to further expand the capabilities of its models.\nA link to the ESM3 release blog post describing the preprint paper can be found on our website at https://www.evolutionaryscale.ai/blog/esm3-release.\nAbout EvolutionaryScale\nEvolutionaryScale is a frontier AI research lab and Public Benefit Corporation dedicated to developing artificial intelligence for the life sciences.

(Nasdaq: TLSA) ('Tiziana' or the 'Company'), a biotechnology company developing breakthrough immunomodulation therapies via novel routes of drug delivery, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed intranasal foralumab to be used under an Expanded Access (EA) IND in its first patient with moderate Alzheimer's disease. Expanded access IND's provide a pathway for patients to gain access to investigational drugs, biologics, and medical devices used to diagnose, monitor, or treat patients with serious diseases or conditions for which there are no comparable or satisfactory therapy options available outside of clinical trials.\nHoward L. Weiner, M.D., Principal Investigator, Chairman of Tiziana's Scientific Advisory Board and co-director of the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a founding member of Mass General Brigham healthcare system stated, 'I am excited to treat this first patient with moderate AD with nasal foralumab as early as July. These patients have no other treatment options including newly approved anti-amyloid drugs and continue to deteriorate. Given that nasal foralumab dampens microglial inflammation in subjects with advanced progressive MS and microglial activation is a prominent feature of Alzheimer's disease, Tiziana is hopeful that nasal foralumab will help slow the progression of cognitive decline in this first patient. We will work closely with FDA to evaluate the treatment responses in this patient with moderate AD while we initiate our Phase 2 study Alzheimer's Disease in patients with early symptomatic disease.'\nGabriele Cerrone, Chairman, acting CEO and founder of Tiziana Life Sciences commented, 'In addition to our previously announced IND clearance of the Phase 2a early symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease study, this additional FDA clearance allows Tiziana to also study intranasal foralumab in patients with moderate Alzheimer's Disease who do not qualify for approved therapies.' Gabriele Cerrone further commented, 'Foralumab could be a potentially groundbreaking treatment for Alzheimer's disease, given it targets the disease's underlying pathology by addressing the resulting neuroinflammation caused by the accumulation of toxic proteins in the brain.'\nAbout Foralumab\nActivated T cells play an important role in the inflammatory process. Foralumab, the only fully human anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), binds to the T cell receptor and dampens inflammation by modulating T cell function, thereby suppressing effector features in multiple immune cell subsets. This effect has been demonstrated in patients with COVID and with multiple sclerosis, as well as in healthy normal subjects. The non-active SPMS intranasal foralumab Phase 2 trial (NCT06292923) began screening patients in November of 2023. Immunomodulation by nasal anti-CD3 mAb represents a novel avenue for treatment of neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative human diseases.[1],[2]\nAbout Tiziana Life Sciences\nTiziana Life Sciences is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing breakthrough therapies using transformational drug delivery technologies to enable alternative routes of immunotherapy. Tiziana's innovative nasal approach has the potential to provide an improvement in efficacy as well as safety and tolerability compared to intravenous (IV) delivery. Tiziana's lead candidate, intranasal foralumab, which is the only fully human anti-CD3 mAb, has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and clinical response in patients in studies to date. Tiziana's technology for alternative routes of immunotherapy has been patented with several applications pending and is expected to allow for broad pipeline applications.\nFor more information please visit our website: www.tizianalifesciences.com\nFor further inquiries:\nTiziana Life Sciences LtdPaul Spencer, Business Development and Investor Relations+44 (0) 207 495 2379email: info@tizianalifesciences.com\nInvestors:Irina KofflerLifeSci Advisors, LLC646.970.4681ikoffler@lifesciadvisors.com\n[1] https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2220272120\n[2] https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2309221120", "rights": "yahoo.com", "rank": 36, "topic": "news", "country": "US", "language": "en", "authors": "Tiziana Life Sciences Ltd.", "media": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/globenewswire.com/0447654471f9f8d93e31cb212680cfd8", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@YahooFinance", "_score": 13.261965, "_id": "763bf0cf197993d21f0a0e4297357829"}, {"title": "University hosts events to celebrate 200th birthday of Lord Kelvin", "author": "Jody Harrison", "published_date": "2024-06-23 23:10:00", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://uk.news.yahoo.com/university-hosts-events-celebrate-200th-231000955.html", "clean_url": "yahoo.com", "excerpt": "Guests from around the world are to visit Glasgow for a series of events celebrating the 200th anniversary of the birth of Lord Kelvin.", "summary": "Guests from around the world are to visit Glasgow for a series of events celebrating the 200th anniversary of the birth of Lord Kelvin.\nThe University of Glasgow will host a series of public events, a Kelvin-inspired art exhibition, and an international symposium on the legacy of its famous graduate, who was born William Thomson in Belfast on June 26th, 1824.\nLord Kelvin grew up to be one of the 19th century's most accomplished scientists, making breakthrough contributions to physics, engineering and mathematics during his near-lifelong career at the University of Glasgow, where he enrolled as a student aged just 10.\nEach event will cast new light on his life of invention, innovation and inspiration through expert lectures, the display of historical items and records, and artistic interpretation.\nOn Tuesday the Lord Kelvin: Beyond Absolute Zero exhibition will begin a two-week run at the University's Mazumdar-Shaw Advanced Research Centre (ARC).\nLord Kelvin (Image: UofG archives)\nThe exhibition will showcase historical items including an antique Kelvin-designed voltmeter, one of the commercial products he created following his development of accurate methods of measuring electricity.\nThrough videos and text displays, visitors can learn about Kelvin's life and work and some of his lesser-known achievements, including work on chirality, a key scientific concept of molecular symmetry with important applications in biology.\nKelvin's mathematical formula for the most efficient space-filling shape, which remained unsurpassed until 1993, is part of the inspiration for two new paintings created by artist Gregor Harvie in collaboration with researchers from the University's School of Physics & Astronomy.\nThe large canvases \u2013 one filled with colour and one monochrome \u2013 depict the universes of light and dark matter, each depicting an intricate lattice of computer-modelled Kelvin cells inspired by Kelvin's work.\nREAD MORE: Lord Kelvin: The man who helped make the modern world\nGregor Harvie said: 'There has always been a relationship between art and science. They draw on the same pool of cultural and environmental knowledge and have often explored similar ideas. Physics, like art, is a search for patterns \u2013 things that can be recognised and described.\n'I'm delighted to be part of the University's celebrations of Kelvin, and to have been doubly inspired both by his work and that of the researchers building on his insights 117 years after his death.'\nUniversity of Glasgow (Image: University of Glasgow)\nProfessor Stephen Barnett, of the University's Quantum Theory Group, collaborated with Harvie on discussions about the theory behind the paintings for more than a year. He said:\n'Working with Gregor to produce these very striking paintings has been a fantastic experience, and I'm thrilled to see them on display at the University during our Kelvin bicentenary celebrations.\n'Kelvin's work across a wide range of disciplines helped in many ways to create the world we live in today. He made key contributions to laying the first transatlantic telegraph cable, leading directly to our ultra-connected world, and he was the first person to have his home lit entirely by electric light, showing the benefits of electricity. It's wonderful to think that he's continuing to provide inspiration not just for scientists but for artists too.'\nREAD MORE: Lord Kelvin to be remembered with special series of events by University of Glasgow\nAlso on June 25th, Japanese physicist and Nobel laureate Professor Takaaki Kajita will deliver a public lecture on measuring neutrinos and gravitational waves following in the footsteps of Lord Kelvin, who pioneered precision measurements in areas including temperature.\nThe Kelvin scale of of temperature he developed is based on his identification of absolute zero, where all atoms stop moving, at \u2212273.15\u00b0C.\nOn June 26th, the ARC will host the Kelvin Bicentenary Symposium, featuring speakers from the UK and USA presenting talks on how Kelvin's work on precision measurement, thermodynamics, optics and communications helped shape the modern world.\nLater that day, The Hunterian will host Dr Daniel Mitchell of the IEEE History Centre for a lecture on Kelvin's contributions to measurement and quantification, building on Kelvin's famous dictum that 'When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind'.\nA series of events between June 26th and July 9th will showcase Kelvin-related historical items curated by the University of Glasgow Library and The Hunterian. The two-part Collecting Kelvin events will allow visitors to Library and Kelvin Hall a rare opportunity to see some of Kelvin's records, documents, prototypes and scientific instruments in the company for themselves.\nProfessor Sir Anton Muscatelli, principal and vice-chancellor of the University of Glasgow, said: 'Lord Kelvin is one of the key figures of the 573-year history of the University of Glasgow, and we're proud to be celebrating his legacy during this bicentenary year.\n'A true polymath who made vital contributions to a range of scientific disciplines during his life, he was also a pioneering businessman whose inventions helped drive forward the burgeoning industrial revolution.\n'Today, researchers across the University of Glasgow continue to draw inspiration from Kelvin's life and work.'", "rights": "yahoo.com", "rank": 36, "topic": "news", "country": "US", "language": "en", "authors": "Jody Harrison", "media": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/herald_scotland_359/8ba1a4680c25679e70fe890ba145d5c2", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@yahooNewsUK", "_score": 12.943012, "_id": "2f606fbf2b1e7bbad3f86bd9d18dc5c2"}, {"title": "Eckert & Ziegler Subsidiary Pentixapharm Receives Encouraging FDA Feedback to Initiate Phase III Trial with PentixaFor as Radiopharmaceutical Diagnostic in Primary Aldosteronism", "author": "Pentixharm AG", "published_date": "2024-06-25 10:00:00", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eckert-ziegler-subsidiary-pentixapharm-receives-100000430.html", "clean_url": "yahoo.com", "excerpt": "W\u00dcRZBURG, Germany, June 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pentixapharm AG, a radiopharmaceutical development company wholly owned by Eckert & Ziegler SE, today announced that it has received encouraging\u2026", "summary": "W\u00dcRZBURG, Germany, June 25, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pentixapharm AG, a radiopharmaceutical development company wholly owned by Eckert & Ziegler SE, today announced that it has received encouraging feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following a recent Type C meeting with the Agency to directly proceed into a pivotal phase III registration study with its radiopharmaceutical diagnostic Ga68-PentixaFor in Primary Aldosteronism (PA). PA is an adrenal gland disorder also known as Conn's syndrome and the most frequent cause of secondary hypertension (high blood pressure).\nWhile the FDA minutes from the Type C meeting do not constitute a formal approval of a particular development plan, they indicate that the clinical data compiled by various academic groups independently from Pentixapharm might serve as confirmatory evidence, relieving the Company of the requirement to conduct a second well-controlled clinical investigation. The minutes also confirm that Ga68-PentixaFor addresses an unmet medical need for a serious condition and therefore meets two essential criteria for fast track and breakthrough designation, which Pentixapharm can request with its Investigational New Drug (IND) submission to initiate the phase III trial.\nGa68-PentixaFor is a novel tracer used in the positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of aldosterone-hypersecreting adenomas in patients diagnosed with PA. The estimated prevalence of this disease has increased considerably over the years, exceeding 20% in some populations of resistant hypertension1. The disorder is characterized by either a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). The current gold standard for differentiating these conditions is adrenal venous sampling (AVS), a complex and invasive procedure. The vast majority of patients with unilateral PA who undergo adrenalectomy after successful AVS experience complete biochemical normalization2. However, there is a risk of misdiagnosing a bilateral case, in which a patient would not benefit from the removal of the gland.\nDr. Dirk Pleimes, Chief Scientific & Medical Officer at Pentixapharm AG, commented: 'The FDA feedback represents a major milestone for our Company in the development of our lead diagnostic. We aim to evaluate Ga68-PentixaFor as a first-in-class, non-invasive and accurate alternative to adrenal venous sampling, offering the potential to transform diagnostic subtyping in Primary Aldosteronism and improve patient outcomes. This discussion with US regulatory authorities provided important feedback, enabling us to proceed to a US-centric registrational phase III trial to support global authorization applications.'\nAbout Pentixapharm AG\nPentixapharm is a radiopharmaceutical development company founded in 2019, with its headquarters in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany. It is wholly owned by the Eckert & Ziegler Group, one of the world's largest providers of isotope technology for medical, scientific and industrial use.

The company was founded in 2022 by Chief Executive Officer Pankaj Bhargava, M.D., and the team at MPM BioImpact, where Dr. Bhargava is also an entrepreneur partner. MPM BioImpact led the Series A round, with contributing funds from Agent Capital, YK Bioventures, and Mirae Asset Venture Investment. In conjunction with the financing, Agent Capital Partner and Co-Founder Preston Noon has joined the Board of Directors.\nThe funding will allow \u0101shibio to continue to advance development of several investigative therapies including a potential treatment for fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare genetic disease characterized by severe and progressive heterotopic ossification (HO), a pathological condition that causes abnormal bone formation in muscles, tendons, ligaments and other soft tissues. FOP typically starts in early childhood, is characterized by episodic and painful flare-ups, and leads to severe debilitation and shortened life span.\n\"We are building a pipeline of innovative therapeutics that leverage emerging biology and novel mechanisms to impact bone and connective tissue disorders that have no approved treatments or where current treatment options are inadequate,\" said Dr. Bhargava. \"We are grateful to our investors for recognizing the promise of our approach and for supporting our development programs.\"\nThe company's lead program is based on the discovery that the matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) enzyme could serve as a novel target for FOP, as published in Journal of Bone and Mineral Research in February 2024.\nThe research described the case of a unique 35-year-old patient who carries the classic genetic mutation of FOP (ACVR1 R206H, present in over 95% of patients), yet has extreme lack of heterotopic ossification (HO) and near normal mobility. The authors found that the patient has an MMP-9 mutation in addition to the FOP mutation that appears to protect him from flare-ups and the abnormal bone formation typically seen in individuals with FOP. Further studies with MMP-9 gene knockout and pharmacological experiments confirmed that MMP-9 may serve as a novel target in FOP and other more common forms of HO.\n\u0101shibio licensed andecaliximab, a humanized antibody that specifically inhibits MMP-9, from Gilead Sciences, Inc. Andecaliximab has been administered to approximately 1,000 patients in previous clinical trials.\n\u0101shibio plans to initiate a Phase 2/3 trial of andecaliximab in the second half of 2024 in patients with FOP. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designated andecaliximab an Orphan Drug for the treatment of FOP in March 2024, one month after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued its own Orphan Drug Designation for the therapy. The FDA also cleared \u0101shibio's Investigational New Drug (IND) application for andecaliximab in March 2024.\nExperienced senior leadership team announcedPrior to joining MPM BioImpact, Dr. Bhargava was the Oncology Therapeutic Area Head at Gilead Sciences. He has also held executive positions at multiple biotech companies during his career, including Sanofi and Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, where he led development programs for oncology and rare genetic diseases.\nIn addition to completion of the Series A funding, \u0101shibio also announced the following appointments to its senior leadership team:\nVictoria Smith, Ph.D., joins \u0101shibio as Chief Scientific Officer. She has worked across several therapeutic areas including oncology, and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. She has previously held executive or senior positions at Amphivena Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences, and Arresto Biosciences, where she was a co-inventor of andecaliximab.\nDeborah Wenkert, M.D., joins \u0101shibio as Chief Medical Officer. She is an experienced pediatric rheumatologist, specializing in rare bone and connective tissue disorders, with extensive experience in both academic and industry settings. She has previously held executive or clinical development positions at Inozyme Pharma, PreciThera, and Amgen.\n\"At \u0101shibio, we are rapidly advancing novel therapeutics for severe and debilitating bone and connective tissue disorders, an area of great clinical need,\" commented Dr. Smith. \"It is extremely gratifying to be a part of such an impressive team of seasoned industry executives, clinicians, and researchers who are devoted to improving the lives of patients who have not been adequately served by currently available treatment options.\"\n\"\u0101shibio is clearly at the forefront of drug development in heterotopic ossification and other bone and connective tissue pathologies,\" added Todd Foley, managing partner at MPM BioImpact and Chair of the \u0101shibio Board of Directors. \"The company is now on a clinical path for its lead asset and is poised to advance a pipeline of programs that address unmet needs.\"\n\u0101shibio researchers will present an update on the andecaliximab FOP program in an oral and poster presentation at the FOP Drug Development Forum in Stockholm, Sweden on June 27-28, 2024.

(Nasdaq: KURA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer, today reported preclinical data supporting the potential therapeutic utility of menin inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes. The new findings were presented this weekend at the American Diabetes Association's 84th Scientific Sessions in Orlando. Copies of the presentation are available in the Posters and Presentations section on Kura's website.\n'Despite the introduction of multiple options for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, a significant unmet need exists as a large proportion of patients do not achieve glycemic control,' said Francis Burrows, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Translational Research. 'We are encouraged by these preclinical data for ziftomenib in diabetes, which demonstrate the potential for menin inhibitors to enhance pancreatic function and warrant further evaluation in diabetes.'\nType 2 diabetes is marked by an inadequate number of functional pancreatic beta cells, which results in insufficient insulin production, leading to hyperglycemia. Ziftomenib demonstrated meaningful levels of glycemic control in preclinical in vivo models, including reduced fasting blood glucose levels and %HbA1C within 27 days as well as consistent improvement in both insulin sensitivity and insulin production. The data show that the effects of ziftomenib were fully maintained following dose discontinuation, suggesting restoration of beta-cell mass. A decline in pancreatic beta-cell function and/or mass has been defined as a key contributing factor to disease progression in type 2 diabetes. Notably, in human islet microtissues originating from two donor samples, ziftomenib induced beta-cell proliferation while non-beta-cell proliferation was not detectable, demonstrating menin is a viable therapeutic target for beta-cell mass specific expansion.\nKura's first-generation menin inhibitor, ziftomenib, is currently in clinical development as both a monotherapy and in combination with standards of care for the treatment of acute leukemias, and it recently received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) NPM1-mutant AML. Meanwhile, the Company continues to make progress toward multiple next-generation menin inhibitor drug candidates, targeting diabetes and other metabolic diseases.\nAbout Type 2 Diabetes\nDiabetes mellitus is characterized by a reduced ability of the body to produce insulin and/or by a dysregulated response to insulin. Diabetes is grouped into two clinical categories according to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) \u2013 type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes \u2013 the latter accounting for 25.3 million diagnosed patients in the U.S. A decline in pancreatic beta-cell function and/or mass has been defined as a key contributing factor to disease progression in type 2 diabetes. Loss of functional beta-cell mass is a core component of the natural history in type 2 diabetes (mediated by metabolic dysfunction). Beta cells are found in the pancreas and are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy and helps control blood glucose levels. Although glycemic control is a validated approach to delaying disease progression, many patients do not achieve glycemic control, which can lead to significant and potentially fatal renal, cardiac, neurological, and ophthalmic comorbidities.\nAbout Kura Oncology\nKura Oncology is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to realizing the promise of precision medicines for the treatment of cancer. The Company's pipeline consists of small molecule drug candidates that target cancer signaling pathways. Ziftomenib, a once-daily, oral drug candidate targeting the menin-KMT2A protein-protein interaction, has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation for the treatment of R/R NPM1-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Kura has completed enrollment in a Phase 2 registration-directed trial of ziftomenib in R/R NPM1-mutant AML (KOMET-001). The Company is also conducting a series of clinical trials to evaluate ziftomenib in combination with current standards of care in newly diagnosed and R/R NPM1-mutant and KMT2A-rearranged AML. Tipifarnib, a potent and selective farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI), is currently in a Phase 1/2 trial in combination with alpelisib for patients with PIK3CA-dependent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (KURRENT-HN). Kura is also evaluating KO-2806, a next-generation FTI, in a Phase 1 dose-escalation trial as a monotherapy and in combination with targeted therapies (FIT-001).

The product is indicated for the vaccination of healthy dogs eight weeks of age or older against canine influenza H3N2.\n\"As a leader in innovation and trusted advocate for disease prevention, Merck Animal Health uses its leadership and expertise in research and development to make medicines that help keep pets safe,\" said Ian Tarpey, vice president, research and development, Merck Animal Health. \"The NOBIVAC NXT innovation represents a major advancement in vaccine technology and furthers our commitment to animal care by helping veterinarians protect pets from significant disease and ultimately, improve their lives by preventing health issues.\"\nCanine influenza, or dog flu, is a serious respiratory illness that is easily transmitted from dog to dog. Canines are social creatures by nature and are at risk for infection when exposed to the virus. Moreover, unlike human flu, canine influenza is not seasonal; dogs are susceptible to it year-round, which is why it's important to vaccinate every year.\n\"Vaccination is the best form of protection against this highly transmissible disease. When canine influenza does show up in large outbreaks, it can have a widespread impact,\" said Meg Conlon, DVM, executive director, veterinary professional services, Merck Animal Health. \"Pets have become part of the family and are integrated into so many aspects of our lives, which makes vaccination even more crucial. At Merck Animal Health, we continue to stress the importance of preventative care to keep our beloved pets healthy and protected from potential illness.\"\nMerck Animal Health has been leading canine influenza protection since launching the first canine influenza vaccine \u2013 NOBIVAC\u00ae Canine Flu H3N8 \u2013 in 2009. When canine influenza H3N2 emerged as an epidemic in the U.S. in 2015, Merck Animal Health made its monovalent H3N2 vaccine available to protect dogs against the disease; and in 2016, the company was first to receive a fully licensed bivalent and monovalent H3N2 vaccine. In addition, the company has been advancing canine respiratory protection for decades with its intranasal, canine flu and oral respiratory vaccines that prevent the spread of pathogens and protect the respiratory health of dogs. Now, Merck Animal Health continues its legacy of innovation with the introduction of NOBIVAC\u00ae NXT Canine Flu H3N2.

A deathwatch beetle \u2013 taken from an infected beam on Nelson's great warship \u2013 has been used to create the first fully sequenced genome of the species.\nThe project, carried out by scientists at the Sanger Institute and Oxford University and by National Museum of the Royal Navy conservationists, has made a key breakthrough, say researchers.\nThe beetle, Xestobium rufovillosum, still causes major damage to buildings and boats and also affects hardwood trade in many countries.\nBy unravelling the beetle's genetic blueprint and pinpointing the 476m units of DNA that make up its genome, scientists have taken a major step in finding new ways to combat deathwatch desecration.\n'By sequencing all the beetle's DNA, we are now much better equipped to find ways of tackling the damage it causes,' said Prof Mark Blaxter, of the Sanger Institute, where the genome was sequenced.\nThe Sanger's involvement with the deathwatch is part of its Tree of Life initiative, which involves scientists working with a global network of other genetics projects in order to sequence the genomes for every known species on Earth.\nThe aim is to produce an evolutionary history of genes and species for the entire planet.\n'The deathwatch is the latest of the 150 beetle species whose genomes we have already sequenced,' added Blaxter.\n'None came from samples with the historic associations of the deathwatch, however.'\nThe deathwatch beetle gets its name from the tapping sound it makes when trying to attract a mate. In the past, people living in old houses, keeping vigil by the sickbeds of \u00adrelatives, believed the sound to be a harbinger of death, hence the name.\nAs Mark Twain wrote in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer: 'Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder \u2013 it meant that somebody's days were numbered.'\nThe deathwatch beetle wreaks damage from the effects of its larvae, which hatch from eggs it lays in wood. The species is particularly fond of old oak that is slightly softened by damp and fungus, and larvae can gnaw away at wood for up to 10 years before emerging as adults.\nIn this way, the deathwatch beetle can eat and hollow out beams, weakening whole structures and leading to building collapses \u2013 as nearly happened in Westminster Hall in 1913.\nOld sailing vessels are also affected, including HMS Victory, the world's oldest naval vessel still in \u00adcommission.\nThe Victory was launched in 1765 and is best known for its role as Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It was kept afloat until 1922, when it was moved to a dry dock in Portsmouth and preserved as a museum ship.\nIt was at around this time that the first evidence of deathwatch infestation was observed, said Diana Davis, head of conservation at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth.\n'For almost 100 years, the deathwatch beetle has been responsible for the continued loss of a great deal of historic timber on the Victory,' Davis added.\n'It is something we take very seriously, so this sequencing work is a very important development.\n'For example, we do not know if the Victory was the victim of a single infestation of deathwatch beetle or the subject of several waves of attack. Now that we have its sequence, we have a way to answer this question. It is very exciting.'\nBlaxter added that it is also possible that beetles adopt genes from other organisms, such as fungi, and these could help them to soften and digest wood.\n'By sequencing the deathwatch's genome, we will be able to spot what gene transfers may be helping the beetle's larvae eat wood,' he said.\n'Such a discovery could have considerable benefits not just in helping to combat the deathwatch beetle but also in finding ways to digest wood and boost biogas production.'\nIsolating deathwatch specimens from the Victory involved museum staff capturing insects emerging from holes in its timbers.\nRelated: I discovered a way to identify the millions of species on Earth after a lightbulb moment in the supermarket\n'Each time they got one, they phoned me and headed north,' said zoologist Prof Peter Holland of Oxford University, a key member of the project.\n'I would then head south, and we would meet at a roadside cafe midway between Oxford and Portsmouth on the A34. They would have a beetle in a plastic cup, and I would take it back to our laboratory. Eventually we got a perfect specimen which we passed on to the Sanger Institute.'\nThe crucial point about sequencing the beetle's genome is that it allows \u00adscientists to look at every protein that makes up that organism, Holland added.\n'There will be enzymes, molecules used in communication with other organisms, receptors \u2013 all that sort of biochemistry which become available once you've sequenced the genome,' he said.\n'You get a completely new understanding of an organism. The conservation applications should then appear a little bit further downstream.'", "rights": "yahoo.com", "rank": 36, "topic": "news", "country": "US", "language": "en", "authors": "Robin McKie Science Editor", "media": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/0d0caed2f6666412aa3b4dd91eaf2a94", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@yahooNewsUK", "_score": 9.659226, "_id": "1ca91df5c4f926cae143267133ead751"}, {"title": "Ocugen, Inc.

'Dosing the first patient is especially significant and makes our dedication to serving RP patients\u2014300,000 in the U.S. and Europe and 1.6 million worldwide\u2014more tangible.'\nThe Phase 3 liMeliGhT clinical trial was informed by positive Phase 1/2 OCU400 data that suggests positive trends in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) and Multi-Luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT), and Low-Luminance Visual Acuity (LLVA) among treated eyes. 89% (16/18) of RP subjects demonstrated preservation or improvement in the treated eye either on BCVA or LLVA or MLMT scores from baseline. 80% (8/10) of RHO mutation subjects experienced either preservation or improvement in MLMT scores from baseline. 78% (14/18) of subjects demonstrated preservation or improvement in treated eyes in MLMT scores from baseline.\nThe Phase 3 study\u2014with the duration of one year\u2014will have a sample size of 150 participants\u2014one arm of 75 participants with RHO gene mutations and the other arm with 75 participants that are gene agnostic. In each arm, participants will be randomized 2:1 to the treatment group (2.5 x 1010 vg/eye of OCU400) and untreated control group, respectively. Patients eight years of age and older, with early through late-stage advancement of RP, are being recruited to participate in the liMeliGhT study.\nLuminance Dependent Navigation Assessment (LDNA)\u2014a more sensitive and specific measurement of function than MLMT used in previous Phase 3 clinical trials\u2014is the primary endpoint for the study. The Phase 3 liMeliGhT study will focus on the proportion of responders, in treated and untreated groups, achieving an improvement of at least 2 Lux levels from baseline in the study eyes.\n'Patients with RP associated with mutations in multiple genes currently have no therapeutic options. As a retinal surgeon, I am encouraged by the therapeutic potential of OCU400 to provide long-term benefit to RP patients,' said Lejla Vajzovic, MD, FASRS, Director, Duke Surgical Vitreoretinal Fellowship Program, Associate Professor of Ophthalmology with Tenure Adult and Pediatric Vitreoretinal Surgery and Disease, Duke University Eye Center, and Retina Scientific Advisory Board Chair of Ocugen. 'OCU400 is a novel modifier gene therapy approach that could initiate a paradigm shift in the treatment of RP and to field of ophthalmology.'\n'The current OCU400 Phase 3 study is very exciting and gives hope for thousands of individuals with RP,' said Benjamin Bakall, MD, PhD, Director of Clinical Research at Associated Retina Consultants (ARC) and Clinical Assistant Professor at University of Arizona, College of Medicine \u2013 Phoenix. 'I am encouraged that we may have a potential treatment option to preserve or improve the vision in RP patients regardless of gene mutation, and very pleased that the first patient dosing in the Phase 3 liMeliGhT clinical trial was performed at ARC.'\n'We are grateful for our continued collaboration with Dr. Bakall and the team at ARC,' said Dr. Huma Qamar, Chief Medical Officer of Ocugen. \"We are excited to expand our enrollment to include more centers and patients representing a diverse array of RP gene mutations, which will be a validation of this novel gene therapy platform. We will provide updates as our progress continues.\"\nOcugen previously announced that OCU400 has received orphan drug and RMAT designations from the FDA and that the EMA provided acceptability of the U.S.-based trial for submission of a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA). With the first dosing of the Phase 3 clinical trial, OCU400 remains on track for the 2026 BLA and MAA approval targets.\nAbout OCU400OCU400 is the Company's gene-agnostic modifier gene therapy product based on nuclear hormone receptor (NHR) gene, NR2E3. NR2E3 regulates diverse physiological functions within the retina\u2014such as photoreceptor development and maintenance, metabolism, phototransduction, inflammation and cell survival networks. Through its drive functionality, OCU400 resets altered/affected cellular gene networks and establishes homeostasis\u2014a state of balance, which has the potential to improve retinal health and function in patients with RP.\nAbout Modifier Gene TherapyModifier gene therapy is designed to fulfill unmet medical needs related to retinal diseases, including IRDs, such as RP, LCA and Stargardt disease, as well as multifactorial diseases like dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD). Our modifier gene therapy platform is based on the use of NHRs, master gene regulators, which have the potential to restore homeostasis \u2014 the basic biological processes in the retina. Unlike single-gene replacement therapies, which only target one genetic mutation, we believe that our modifier gene therapy platform, through its use of NHRs, represents a novel approach that has the potential to address multiple retinal diseases caused by mutations in multiple genes with one product, and to address complex diseases that are potentially caused by imbalances in multiple gene networks. Currently, Ocugen has three modifier gene therapy programs in the clinic: OCU400, OCU410, and OCU410ST. In addition to the OCU400 Phase 3 liMeliGhT clinical trial, the OCU410 Phase 1/2 ArMaDa clinical trial for geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dAMD and the OCU410ST Phase 1/2 GARDian clinical trial for Stargardt disease are currently underway. GA affects approximately two to three million people in the U.S. and EU combined and Stargardt disease affects nearly 100,000 people in the U.S. and EU combined.\nAbout Ocugen, Inc.Ocugen, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing novel gene and cell therapies and vaccines that improve health and offer hope for patients across the globe. We are making an impact on patient's lives through courageous innovation\u2014forging new scientific paths that harness our unique intellectual and human capital. Our breakthrough modifier gene therapy platform has the potential to treat multiple retinal diseases with a single product, and we are advancing research in infectious diseases to support public health and orthopedic diseases to address unmet medical needs.

But until now, scientists disputed where they came from.", "summary": "For millions of years, mighty baobabs have been standing sentry on three different landmasses, posing each other an existential question: Who came first?\nThe giant trees, swollen of trunk and stubby of canopy, are unmistakable. Baobabs can live for more than 1,000 years, acting as the keystone species in dry forest environments in Madagascar, a swathe of continental Africa, and northwest Australia. Known as 'mother of the forest' and 'the tree of life,' nearly every part of the tree can be used by humans and animals, meaning they're of enormous value to each ecosystem they inhabit.\nTheir reputation has only been burnished by the mystery as to where they originated. Until now, science has had to make do with multiple conflicting hypotheses \u2013 the dominant theory being that they came from mainland Africa. Not so, according to a study published last month in the journal Nature. A team of international academics successfully sequenced the genomes of each of the eight baobab species, examining their relationship with one another and concluded that they originated in Madagascar.\nThe news comes as the trees face a precipitous decline on the island, home to six baobab species, with one likely to become extinct by 2080 according to the study, unless significant interventions are put in place.\nBiologists had struggled to determine the tree's origins, as no fossils of ancient baobabs or their ancestors have been discovered, explained Dr. Wan Jun-Nan, one of the authors of the study, a researcher at the Wuhan Botanical Garden in Hubei, China.

Baobabs can live for more than 1,000 years, acting as the keystone species in dry forest environments in Madagascar, a swathe of continental Africa, and northwest Australia. Known as 'mother of the forest' and 'the tree of life,' nearly every part of the tree can be used by humans and animals, meaning they're of enormous value to each ecosystem they inhabit.\nTheir reputation has only been burnished by the mystery as to where they originated. Until now, science has had to make do with multiple conflicting hypotheses \u2013 the dominant theory being that they came from mainland Africa. Not so, according to a study published last month in the journal Nature. A team of international academics successfully sequenced the genomes of each of the eight baobab species, examining their relationship with one another and concluded that they originated in Madagascar.\nThe news comes as the trees face a precipitous decline on the island, home to six baobab species, with one likely to become extinct by 2080 according to the study, unless significant interventions are put in place.\nBiologists had struggled to determine the tree's origins, as no fossils of ancient baobabs or their ancestors have been discovered, explained Dr. Wan Jun-Nan, one of the authors of the study, a researcher at the Wuhan Botanical Garden in Hubei, China.

The financing was led by Asabys Partners, with participation from Eli Lilly and Company, and the US-based Charcot-Marie-Tooth Research Foundation. Current investors AdBio partners, V-Bio Ventures, PMV, VIB and Gemma Frisius Fund also joined the round.\nAugustine Therapeutics is developing best-in-class, novel, potent and subtype-selective small-molecule inhibitors of the cytosolic Histone DeACetylase 6 (HDAC6) enzyme, a class II histone deacetylase. HDAC6 is a well-known molecular target with strong biological rationale for neurological disorders and high therapeutic potential in cardiometabolic disease. Inhibition of HDAC6 plays a leading role in axonal protection and regeneration by controlling the efficiency of internal axonal transport. Augustine's novel generation of HDAC6 inhibitors (HDAC6i) are chemically distinct and superior to the first generation hydroxamate-based inhibitors developed so far, allowing them to safely and selectively reverse and inhibit the pathophysiological changes associated with neuromuscular diseases such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT), peripheral neuropathies induced by chemotherapies (CIPN), as well as neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).\nThe proceeds from this first close will be used to advance Augustine's lead candidate, AGT100216, into a Phase 1/2 first-in-human clinical trial in 2025. AGT100216 is a peripherally restricted and selective small molecule HDAC6i with a unique mechanism-of-action that has strong potential in CMT and CIPN. The financing will further support the development of the company's pipeline, including the advancement of its next-generation drug candidates with additional peripheral-restricted or brain penetrant properties for cardiometabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, as well as fund the expansion of the Augustine executive and R&D team.\n\"The support from both new and existing investors in this first closing is a reflection of the tremendous efforts and scientific excellence of our team in advancing a unique pipeline of potential breakthrough therapeutics for patients,\" said Sylvain Celanire, CEO of Augustine Therapeutics. \"Our HDAC6 inhibitors have unique properties designed to achieve meaningful benefits for patients with neurodegenerative and cardiometabolic diseases. Our first clinical candidate, AGT100216, has demonstrated impressive preclinical efficacy in CMT studies highlighting its ability to halt disease progression, significantly reverse the disease phenotype and rescue axonal integrity in a dose-dependent manner. We are looking forward to capitalizing on our unique pipeline with the strategic insights we are gaining from our Board and Executive Chairman Gerhard Koenig.\"\nClara Camp\u00e0s, Founding and Managing Partner at Asabys Partners, said: \"Augustine's molecules are unique, selective and potent, providing a competitive advantage in modulating a validated target with potential impact in a large variety of indications. Augustine's novel generation of chemically distinct HDAC6 inhibitors are unprecedented and have the potential to overcome some of the typical limitations of other HDAC6 inhibitors currently being tested in early clinical development. We are thrilled to have joined a strong consortium of investors alongside Eli Lilly and Company, the current investors and Augustine's exceptional team to further develop these molecules to clinical proof of concept.\"\nIn conjunction with the financing, Clara Camp\u00e0s, Founding and Managing Partner at Asabys Partners, has joined Augustine Therapeutics' Board of Directors. Isabel Jim\u00e9nez, Associate at Asabys, and a representative from Eli Lilly and Company, will join as Board Observers.\nIn addition, Augustine Therapeutics announced today the appointment of Gerhard Koenig as Executive Chairman of its Board of Directors. Gerhard Koenig has been a Non-Executive Director on Augustine's Board since May 2022, and currently serves as CEO and Founder of Arkuda Therapeutics, a Boston-based biotech company, focused on the development of lysosomal function enhancers in neurodegenerative diseases. Gerhard is also a Board Member of Vigil Therapeutics (NASDAQ: VIGL) focused on rectifying Microglial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.\nFull bios of the complete Board of Directors can be found on the company's website via this link.\nAbout Augustine TherapeuticsAugustine Therapeutics is a Belgian biotech company, founded in 2019 and a spin-off company of VIB-KU Leuven.

The research is still early, but researchers are excited by the prospect of advances for a disease that lacks good diagnostics and treatments.\nThe target of both innovations is alpha synuclein, a protein that takes an abnormal form in Parkinson's patients\u2014aggregating in their brains and destroying nerve cells involved in motor and some cognitive functions. While researchers have long known that these proteins are involved in the disease, finding ways to measure and target them has not been easy.\nThe (potential) Parkinson's vaccine\nThe Florida-based biotech company Vaxxinity developed a vaccine, or what it calls an active immune medicine, to train the immune system to attack only abnormal versions of the protein\u2014which are improperly folded\u2014and not the regular forms. This would essentially help people's bodies treat themselves.\n'The idea is that patients should recognize their own misfolded proteins, and it is personalized because their own immune systems are doing the work,' says Dr. Mark Frasier, chief scientific officer at the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, which funded the testing part of the study.\nThe Parkinson's test\nThe new diagnostic test for Parkinson's, which was developed by researchers at University of Texas and Vaxxinity, uses samples of cerebrospinal fluid to measure a person's levels of abnormal alpha synuclein. If the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) grants it full approval, it will become the first test for diagnosing Parkinson's. (The FDA classified it as a breakthrough device in 2019, a status that expedites access to innovative technologies where there is unmet need.) 'Without [such a test], you're kind of shooting in the dark,' says Mei Mei Hu, CEO and co-founder of Vaxxinity.\nAlpha synuclein has been tricky to measure in the body for several reasons, says Frasier. While everyone has the protein, abnormal forms of it occur in relatively small amounts, so they're harder to detect via imaging. This type of alpha synuclein also tends to clump inside cells rather than outside of them, making it even harder to see. If clumps are large enough to become detectable, they can look structurally similar to amyloid or tau\u2014the proteins implicated in Alzheimer's disease\u2014so imaging tests might misdiagnose people with Alzheimer's rather than Parkinson's.\nRead More: Michael J. Fox: Chasing Parkinson's Treatments\nThe test overcomes those hurdles by cleverly exploiting normal forms of the protein. Parkinson's experts believe that tiny amounts of abnormal alpha synuclein circulate in the spinal fluid of patients, but are too small to be detected through imaging. To run the new test in the study, researchers take normal forms of the protein in the lab and add them to samples of spinal fluid from patients; that prompts any misfolded protein that might be present in the samples to pull the normal proteins into misfolded aggregates, amplifying the signal for the abnormal form. Scientists then use a fluorescent probe to detect how much antibody to the misfolded protein patients generated, resulting in a biomarker, or stand-in for the treatment effect.\nThis test would be a critical advance because it makes it possible to identify patients with abnormal alpha synuclein at the earliest stages of the disease, when treatments might be more effective.\nWith more data from patients, researchers hope to further refine what different levels mean, so that the test will be able to tell not just if a person has Parkinson's but whether someone might be at a greater risk of developing it. Currently the test is only used in research studies, but more results like these\u2014as well as data on whether the same process can be applied to blood samples\u2014could speed the test to getting approved for wider use.\nWhat the study found\nThe trial\u2014conducted by researchers at the University of Texas, the Mayo Clinic, the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research, and Vaxxinity\u2014included 20 people with Parkinson's. It was just designed to test the safety of the approach, so the study only provided hints about the treatment's effectiveness. Everyone received three shots over nearly a year; some contained the treatment at different doses, and some contained a placebo.\nOverall, people receiving the vaccine generated more antibodies against the abnormal alpha synuclein protein than those vaccinated with placebo, as measured by the Parkinson's test. Antibodies started to ramp up about four months after the vaccinations began.\nRead More: Changing Your Diet and Lifestyle May Slow Down Alzheimer's\n'What is unique about our technology is that it can stimulate the immune system to produce very, very specific antibodies against toxic forms of alpha synuclein, and do it in a safe way, which is reassuring,' says Jean-Cosme Dodart, senior vice president of research at Vaxxinity and senior author of the paper.\nAccording to the test results, about half of the patients in the trial showed high levels of antibodies against the misfolded alpha synuclein, and most of these patients received the highest dose of the vaccine. They also scored the highest on motor and cognitive tests. There were too few patients to adequately assess any changes of Parkinson's symptoms, but the researchers believe that longer follow-up with those tests, and potentially more frequent or higher doses of the vaccine, could lead to improvements in those scores. 'The results are very, very encouraging,' says Dodart.\n'This paper demonstrates that in a small number of people, the vaccine is having an impact on misfolded alpha synuclein, which is really exciting,' says Frasier.

Photograph: Tomasz Klejdysz/Shutterstock\n' By sequencing all the beetle's DNA, we are now much better equipped to find ways of tackling the damage it causes,' said Prof Mark Blaxter, of the Sanger Institute, where the genome was sequenced .\nThe Sanger's involvement with the deathwatch is part of its Tree of Life initiative, which involves scientists working with a global network of other genetics projects in order to sequence the genomes for every known species on Earth.\nThe aim is to produce an evolutionary history of genes and species for the entire planet.\n'The deathwatch is the latest of the 150 beetle species whose genomes we have already sequenced,' added Blaxter.\n'None came from samples with the historic associations of the deathwatch, however.'\nThe deathwatch beetle gets its name from the tapping sound it makes when trying to attract a mate. In the past, people living in old houses, keeping vigil by the sickbeds of \u00adrelatives, believed the sound to be a harbinger of death, hence the name.\nAs Mark Twain wrote in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer : 'Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall at the bed's head made Tom shudder \u2013 it meant that somebody's days were numbered.'\nThe deathwatch beetle wreaks damage from the effects of its larvae, which hatch from eggs it lays in wood. The species is particularly fond of old oak that is slightly softened by damp and fungus, and larvae can gnaw away at wood for up to 10 years before emerging as adults.\nIn this way, the deathwatch beetle can eat and hollow out beams, weakening whole structures and leading to building collapses \u2013 as nearly happened in Westminster Hall in 1913. The medieval roof of Westminster Hall, refurbished in 2019, nearly collapsed in 1913 because of deathwatch beetle damage. Photograph: Simon Turner/Alamy\nOld sailing vessels are also affected, including HMS Victory, the world's oldest naval vessel still in \u00adcommission.\nThe Victory was launched in 1765 and is best known for its role as Nelson's flagship at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. It was kept afloat until 1922, when it was moved to a dry dock in Portsmouth and preserved as a museum ship.\nIt was at around this time that the first evidence of deathwatch infestation was observed, said Diana Davis, head of conservation at the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth.\n'For almost 100 years, the deathwatch beetle has been responsible for the continued loss of a great deal of historic timber on the Victory,' Davis added. skip past newsletter promotion\nSign up to Observed\nAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writers Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now that we have its sequence, we have a way to answer this question. It is very exciting.'\nBlaxter added that it is also possible that beetles adopt genes from other organisms, such as fungi, and these could help them to soften and digest wood.\n'By sequencing the deathwatch's genome, we will be able to spot what gene transfers may be helping the beetle's larvae eat wood,' he said.\n'Such a discovery could have considerable benefits not just in helping to combat the deathwatch beetle but also in finding ways to digest wood and boost biogas production.'\nIsolating deathwatch specimens from the Victory involved museum staff capturing insects emerging from holes in its timbers.\n'Each time they got one, they phoned me and headed north,' said zoologist Prof Peter Holland of Oxford University, a key member of the project.\n'I would then head south, and we would meet at a roadside cafe midway between Oxford and Portsmouth on the A34. They would have a beetle in a plastic cup, and I would take it back to our laboratory. Eventually we got a perfect specimen which we passed on to the Sanger Institute.'\nThe crucial point about sequencing the beetle's genome is that it allows \u00adscientists to look at every protein that makes up that organism, Holland added.\n'There will be enzymes, molecules used in communication with other organisms, receptors \u2013 all that sort of biochemistry which become available once you've sequenced the genome,' he said.\n'You get a completely new understanding of an organism. The conservation applications should then appear a little bit further downstream.'", "rights": "theguardian.com", "rank": 73, "topic": "sport", "country": "GB", "language": "en", "authors": "Robin McKie", "media": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82b7f27499f096dc33d09a91ad8a2489bfabf6ff/0_98_3944_2366/master/3944.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ae9f3267f277bf913a6025e33d3efee1", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@guardian", "_score": 9.301746, "_id": "3c308e2ae3d5471943dc275d5eadc2ec"}, {"title": "Luxury Massage Chair Market size is set to grow by USD 281.4 million from 2024-2028, Growing work-related stress and need for stress-relieving solutions boost the market, Technavio", "author": "PR Newswire", "published_date": "2024-06-26 21:05:00", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/luxury-massage-chair-market-size-210500481.html", "clean_url": "yahoo.com", "excerpt": "The global luxury massage chair market size is estimated to grow by USD 281.4 million from 2024-2028, according to Technavio.

We are enthusiastic about OCU410ST as a potential one-time treatment for life with a single sub-retinal injection. We look forward to sharing a clinical trial update later this year.\"\nThe Phase 1/2 GARDian clinical trial will include up to 42 subjects\u201430 adults and 12 children with Stargardt disease\u2014who exhibit mild to moderate disease symptoms and will assess the safety of unilateral subretinal administration of OCU410ST. The clinical trial is being conducted in two phases. Phase 1 is a multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging/dose-escalation study consisting of three dose levels [low dose (3.75\u00d7 1010 vg/mL), medium dose (7.5\u00d7 1010 vg/mL), and high dose (2.25\u00d7 1011 vg/mL)]. Phase 2 is a randomized, outcome accessor-blinded, dose-expansion study in which adult and pediatric subjects will be enrolled in a 1:1:1 ratio to randomize subjects into two different treatment groups at varying dose levels, or a control (untreated group), allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the treatment's efficacy across different dosages.\nCurrently, patients with Stargardt disease have no FDA-approved therapeutic options. Ocugen is dedicated to providing a gene-agnostic treatment approach for patients living with inherited retinal diseases and is encouraged that the Phase 1/2 GARDian trial for OCU410ST remains on track.\nAbout Stargardt Disease\nStargardt disease is a genetic eye disorder that causes retinal degeneration and vision loss. Stargardt disease is the most common form of inherited macular degeneration. The progressive vision loss associated with Stargardt disease is caused by the degeneration of photoreceptor cells in the central portion of the retina called the macula.\nDecreased central vision due to loss of photoreceptors in the macula is the hallmark of Stargardt disease. Some peripheral vision is usually preserved. Stargardt disease typically develops during childhood or adolescence, but the age of onset and rate of progression can vary. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a layer of cells supporting photoreceptors, is also affected in people with Stargardt disease.\nAbout OCU410ST\nOCU410ST utilizes an AAV delivery platform for the retinal delivery of the RORA (RAR Related Orphan Receptor A) gene. It represents Ocugen's modifier gene therapy approach, which is based on Nuclear Hormone Receptor (NHR) RORA that regulates pathway links to Stargardt disease such as lipofuscin formation, oxidative stress, complement formation, inflammation, and cell survival networks.\nAbout Ocugen, Inc.Ocugen, Inc. is a biotechnology company focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing novel gene and cell therapies and vaccines that improve health and offer hope for patients across the globe. We are making an impact on patient's lives through courageous innovation\u2014forging new scientific paths that harness our unique intellectual and human capital.

The CRL did not identify any issues with the efficacy or safety data submitted.\nPatritumab deruxtecan is a specifically engineered potential first-in-class HER3 directed DXd antibody drug conjugate (ADC) discovered by Daiichi Sankyo and being jointly developed by Daiichi Sankyo and Merck.\n\"We will work closely with the FDA and the third-party manufacturer to address the feedback as quickly as possible in order to bring the first HER3 directed medicine to patients with previously-treated EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer,\" said Ken Takeshita, MD, Global Head, R&D, Daiichi Sankyo. \"We remain confident in the ability to develop this medicine to its full potential.\"\n\"Patients with previously treated EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer often experience recurrence and have limited treatment options,\" said Marjorie Green, MD, Senior Vice President and Head of Oncology, Global Clinical Development, Merck Research Laboratories. \"We are committed to working with Daiichi Sankyo and the FDA to prioritize bringing patritumab deruxtecan to these patients in need.\"\nThe BLA is based on the primary results from the HERTHENA-Lung01 pivotal phase 2 trial that were presented at the IASLC 2023 World Conference on Lung Cancer (#WCLC23) and simultaneously published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.\nIn HERTHENA-Lung01, patritumab deruxtecan was studied in 225 patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC following disease progression with an EGFR TKI and platinum-based chemotherapy, which demonstrated an objective response rate (ORR) of 29.8% (95% CI: 23.9-36.2), including one complete response and 66 partial responses. The median duration of response (DoR) was 6.4 months (95% CI: 4.9-7.8).\nThe safety profile of patritumab deruxtecan observed in HERTHENA-Lung01 was consistent with previous phase 1 clinical trials in NSCLC with a treatment discontinuation rate of 7.1% due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Grade 3 or higher TEAEs occurred in 64.9% of patients. The most common (\u22655%) grade 3 or higher TEAEs were thrombocytopenia (21%), neutropenia (19%), anemia (14%), leukopenia (10%), fatigue (6%), hypokalemia (5%) and asthenia (5%). Twelve patients (5.3%) had confirmed treatment-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) as determined by an independent adjudication committee. One grade 5 ILD event was observed.\nAbout HERTHENA-Lung01HERTHENA-Lung01 is a global, multicenter, open-label, two-arm phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of patritumab deruxtecan in patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC following disease progression with an EGFR TKI and platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive 5.6 mg/kg (n=225) or an uptitration regimen (n=50). The uptitration arm was discontinued as the dose of 5.6 mg/kg of patritumab deruxtecan was selected following a risk-benefit analysis conducted from the phase 1 trial assessing the doses in a similar patient population.\nThe primary endpoint of HERTHENA-Lung01 was ORR as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR). Secondary endpoints included DoR, progression-free survival, disease control rate, and time to response \u2013 all assessed by both BICR and investigator assessment \u2013 as well as investigator-assessed ORR, overall survival, safety and tolerability.\nHERTHENA-Lung01 enrolled patients in Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania. For more information about the trial, visit ClinicalTrials.gov.\nAbout EGFR-Mutated Non-Small Cell Lung CancerApproximately 226,000 lung cancer cases were diagnosed in the U.S. in 2022.1 Lung cancer is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S.1 NSCLC accounts for approximately 81% of all lung cancers in the U.S., with 52% having distant spread at diagnosis.2,3 EGFR mutations occur in approximately one in five patients with NSCLC in Western populations.4\nAbout HER3HER3 is a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases.5 It is estimated that about 83% of primary NSCLC tumors and 90% of advanced EGFR-mutated tumors express HER3 after prior EGFR TKI treatment.6,7 HER3 is associated with poor treatment outcomes, including shorter relapse-free survival and significantly reduced survival.8,9 There is currently no HER3 directed therapy approved for the treatment of any cancer.\nAbout Patritumab DeruxtecanPatritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) is an investigational HER3 directed ADC. Designed using Daiichi Sankyo's proprietary DXd ADC Technology, patritumab deruxtecan is composed of a fully human anti-HER3 IgG1 monoclonal antibody attached to a number of topoisomerase I inhibitor payloads (an exatecan derivative, DXd) via tetrapeptide-based cleavable linkers.\nPatritumab deruxtecan was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2021 for the treatment of patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with disease progression on or after treatment with a third-generation TKI and platinum-based therapies.\nPatritumab deruxtecan is currently being evaluated as both a monotherapy and in combination with other therapies in a global development program, which includes HERTHENA-Lung02, a phase 3 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of patritumab deruxtecan versus platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC following disease progression on or after treatment with a third-generation EGFR TKI; HERTHENA-Lung01, a phase 2 trial in metastatic or locally advanced NSCLC with an activating EGFR mutation previously treated with at least one EGFR TKI and one platinum-based chemotherapy-containing regimen; HERTHENA-PanTumor01, a phase 2 trial in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, including melanoma, gastric and head and neck cancer, among other types of cancer, previously treated with at least one prior systemic therapy; a phase 1 trial in combination with osimertinib in EGFR-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC; and a phase 1 trial in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC. A phase 1/2 trial in HER3 expressing metastatic breast cancer also has been completed.\nAbout the Daiichi Sankyo and Merck CollaborationDaiichi Sankyo and Merck entered into a global collaboration in October 2023 to jointly develop and commercialize patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd), ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd) and raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd), except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will maintain exclusive rights.

(NASDAQ: IBRX) today announced the initial treatment of multiple patients in the United States to receive therapy with ANKTIVA\u00ae (nogapendekin alfa inbakicept-pmln), ImmunityBio's recently approved immunotherapy for Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG)-unresponsive non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) carcinoma in situ. ANKTIVA was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 22, 2024 for the treatment of patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS with or without papillary tumors.\nThe intravesical therapy employs a combination of ANKTIVA, an IL-15 agonist in combination with BCG. The combination is the first FDA-approved immunotherapy in NMIBC that functions by activating the body's NK and killer T-cell immune system to attack tumor cells, while simultaneously activating memory T cells, leading to a prolonged duration of complete response exceeding 47 months for some patients.\n\"We are grateful to be able to offer this first-in-class immunotherapy to qualified bladder cancer patients less than two months after the therapeutic was approved by the FDA,\" said Patrick Soon-Shiong, M.D., Executive Chairman and Global Chief Scientific and Medical Officer at ImmunityBio. \"The interest in this next era of immunotherapy beyond checkpoint inhibitors\u2014the era of cytokines\u2014from urologists treating NMIBC patients has been strong and we look forward to offering more patients an alternative to bladder removal.\"\nThe first patients to receive commercial doses are located throughout the U.S. and several are being treated by community urologists, as the therapy does not require any special handling or equipment that would limit its use to specialty medical centers.\n\"In addition to its unique mechanism of action, ANKTIVA can be readily administered by urologists in their own offices and clinics enabling more patients to receive it in familiar settings from their own providers,\" said Richard Adcock, President and CEO of ImmunityBio. \"We look forward to ANKTIVA reaching more and more eligible NMIBC patients and for our science to deliver even more therapies from our pipeline.\"\nANKTIVA received Breakthrough Therapy Designation and approval from the FDA based on the safety and efficacy outcome of complete responses (CR) and duration of complete response (DOR) in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC CIS. The 77 evaluable patients in this single-arm, multicenter trial received ANKTIVA with BCG maintenance therapy for up to 37 months. The tumor status was assessed with cystoscopy and urine cytology and will continue for up to five years after each patient began their participation in the trial.\nThe CR rate for the 77 evaluable patients was 62% with the upper end of the confidence interval being 73%. The duration of complete response as of the November 2023 cut-off was more than 47 months and is ongoing to date. These prolonged duration of complete response results beyond 24 months with ANKTIVA and BCG exceed the benchmark for the magnitude of meaningful clinical results suggested by a panel of experts at the International Bladder Cancer Group.\nIn May, ImmunityBio announced it had drug substance sufficient for 170,000 doses of ANKTIVA for commercial and clinical trial use.\nImmunityBio CARE\u2122\nThe ImmunityBio CARE\u2122 program is designed to help patients access ImmunityBio's innovative treatment for NMIBC CIS. The program offers services and resources for benefits investigation, prior authorization support and tracking, coding and billing assistance, claim denial guidance and payer specific appeal assistance. More information for patients and healthcare professionals is available on Anktiva.com.\nHow ANKTIVA Works\nThe cytokine interleukin-15 (IL-15) plays a crucial role in the immune system by affecting the development, maintenance, and function of key immune cells\u2014NK and CD8+ killer T cells\u2014that are involved in killing cancer cells. By activating NK cells, ANKTIVA overcomes the tumor escape phase of clones resistant to T cells and restores memory T cell activity with resultant prolonged duration of complete response.\nANKTIVA is a first-in-class IL-15 agonist IgG1 fusion complex, consisting of an IL-15 mutant (IL-15N72D) fused with an IL-15 receptor alpha, which binds with high affinity to IL-15 receptors on NK, CD4+, and CD8+ T cells. This fusion complex of ANKTIVA mimics the natural biological properties of the membrane-bound IL-15 receptor alpha, delivering IL-15 by dendritic cells and drives the activation and proliferation of NK cells with the generation of memory killer T cells that have retained immune memory against these tumor clones. The proliferation of the trifecta of these immune killing cells and the activation of trained immune memory results in immunogenic cell death, inducing a state of equilibrium with durable complete responses. ANKTIVA has improved pharmacokinetic properties, longer persistence in lymphoid tissues, and enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to native, non-complexed IL-15 in-vivo.\nSelected Safety Information for ANKTIVA\nThe most common (\u226515%) adverse reactions, including laboratory test abnormalities, are increased creatinine, dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, micturition urgency, urinary tract infection, increased potassium, musculoskeletal pain, chills, and pyrexia.\nAbout ImmunityBio\nImmunityBio is a vertically-integrated biotechnology company developing next-generation therapies and vaccines that bolster the natural immune system to defeat cancers and infectious diseases. The company's range of immunotherapy and cell therapy platforms, alone and together, act to drive and sustain an immune response with the goal of creating durable and safe protection against disease. Designated an FDA Breakthrough Therapy, ANKTIVA\u00ae is the first FDA-approved immunotherapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer that activates natural killer cells, T cells, and memory T cells for a long duration response. The company is applying its science and platforms to treating cancers, including the development of potential cancer vaccines, as well as developing immunotherapies and cell therapies that we believe sharply reduce or eliminate the need for standard high-dose chemotherapy. These platforms and their associated product candidates are designed to be more effective, accessible, and easily administered than current standards of care in oncology and infectious diseases.\nFor more information, please visit: www.immunitybio.com\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements regarding commercial launch activities and timing, product demand, patient treatment, data and results from clinical trials and potential implications therefrom, product availability and supply, potential regulatory pathways and approval requests and submissions, the regulatory review process and timing thereof, market and prevalence data, potential benefits to patients, potential treatment outcomes for patients, the described mechanism of action and results and contributions therefrom, information regarding ongoing pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, potential future uses and applications of ANKTIVA and use in cancer vaccines and across multiple tumor types, ImmunityBio's financial condition, and ImmunityBio's approved product and investigational agents as compared to existing treatment options, among others.

But it omitted a key stop: her visit to Huawei Technologies Co.'s headquarters, according to communications and documents reviewed by Bloomberg News.\nYouTuber Dr Disrespect Was Allegedly Kicked Off Twitch for Messaging Minor\nNvidia Rout Takes Breather as Traders Scour Charts for Support\nBuzzFeed Struggles to Sell Owner of Hit YouTube Show 'Hot Ones'\nIsrael Court Calls Ultra-Orthodox Men Into Army as Crisis Brews\nJain Global Raises $5.3 Billion, Secures Cash From Abu Dhabi\nBy April, Rogan's under-the-radar meetings at Huawei had become part of a whistleblower complaint about her nonprofit's growing partnership with a Chinese telecommunications giant that's in the crosshairs of US national-security officials.\nA review of internal Optica corporate records shows the alliance ran far deeper than publicly known, blossoming over decades even as US-China tensions over technology soared.\nThe findings expand on a Bloomberg News report in May that Huawei was secretly sponsoring a research competition run by Optica's foundation. That arrangement enabled Huawei to fund millions of dollars worth of cutting-edge studies at US universities without their knowledge, including at schools that ban their researchers from taking Huawei money.\nThe revelations prompted a congressional investigation and a decision by Washington-based Optica to return the funds Huawei had committed to the program and to remove the company's representation on the panel of judges.\nScrutiny over the funding arrangement has dealt a blow to a partnership that effectively helped Huawei preserve access to a pipeline of top-notch US scientists despite its pariah status in Washington. For example, according to Bloomberg's latest findings, at least three of the six US researchers Huawei secretly sponsored through the Optica competition won Pentagon funding around the same time.\nAn April 4 complaint, filed to Optica's general counsel by an employee citing the group's whistleblower policy, flagged Rogan's 'undisclosed' visit to Huawei's headquarters and raised concerns about the company's role in choosing which scientists would receive funding through the competition. The whistleblower also alleged the contest risked compromising US-government-funded work, including efforts backed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.\n'I believe that research that is funded by DARPA and other agencies and patents to which the U.S. government has certain rights have been willfully exported to Huawei and therefore the Chinese government' through the competition, the complaint says, without elaborating on that allegation.\nAn Optica spokesman said that claim is 'simply incorrect' and that 'no research has ever been provided by or thru Optica to Huawei or any government entity.' In an internal communication to staff on June 3, Rogan said the group was 'actively reviewing our policies to ensure both best practices and maximum transparency.'\nA Huawei spokesman said in a statement that the company funded the Optica-branded research competition in order to 'motivate young scientists, encourage academic exchange, and promote global knowledge sharing.' He didn't address questions about Bloomberg's new findings.\nHeadquarters Visit\nFor Optica, a century-old organization that publishes influential scientific journals, the tie-up with a Chinese industrial champion helped it maintain a foothold in a crucial region even as China's rivalry with the US intensified. The society has been increasing its focus on China, its second-largest market after the US and one where it sees untapped potential.\nYet it's a delicate dance, as research by Optica's 24,000 individual members applies to sensitive areas such as semiconductors \u2014 a key battleground in the US-China tech competition, and one where Huawei is a major player.\nRogan's visit to Huawei headquarters came just months after the company's release in August of a new smartphone featuring a 7-nanometer chip whose development US export controls were supposed to foil. In a provocative move, Huawei unveiled the breakthrough while the US official in charge of those controls, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, was visiting China.\nThe Optica spokesman said the group didn't publicize Rogan's visit because it was 'an informal courtesy stop at the end of a two-week trip.' He added that Rogan had 'already sent two internal communications about trip highlights and a third felt excessive at the time.'\nRogan, an accountant who has been the group's CEO since 2002 after previously serving as assistant controller of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, has repeatedly said there was nothing wrong with Optica allowing Huawei to fund the competition. She initially told Bloomberg that some donors preferred to remain anonymous and that there was nothing unusual about the practice.\nBut, in a June 6 letter to Optica's board, Rogan said that Huawei's funding had 'diverted attention from the program's mission to support early career professionals' and that the society would return the company's money.\nThe funding arrangement likely didn't violate Commerce Department regulations blocking technology sharing with Huawei because such rules don't apply to science that's meant to be published, which is what the competition solicits, according to export control experts.\nBut research security specialists said the arrangement undermines university and US government policies meant to ensure scientists' sources of funds are transparent in order to protect both national security and taxpayer dollars.\nHuawei's undisclosed sponsorship caused some competition winners to unknowingly violate bans at their schools on accepting money from the company. It also left some who applied for separate federal funding, such as Pentagon grants, unable to accurately disclose to the US government all of their sources of financial support, which can impact the government's funding decisions.\nEven though Optica has since said it will return Huawei's money, prosecutors could still make a case that its foundation is liable under the False Claims Act for causing researchers to file fraudulent information to the US government regarding their sources of funds, according to Paul Moore. Moore is a former chief investigative counsel at the US Department of Education, where he focused on undisclosed foreign money in higher education.\nThe top Republican and Democrat on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee wrote in a May 16 letter to Rogan that Optica's earlier failure to disclose Huawei's involvement in the competition either showed deep ignorance toward research security or was a 'willful strategy to launder funds from Huawei to anonymously bolster the Optica Foundation's reputation and finances.'\nOptica's spokesman said the group 'is confident that we acted properly and in good faith' in its handling of the Huawei funding.\nSame Scientists\nHuawei was able to secretly fund some of the same scientists the Pentagon and other US agencies chose to sponsor for critical projects around the same time, according to government and university announcements. These scientists were selected for a DARPA effort to develop light-based computing chips; a study of thermal emission by the Office of Naval Research's Sea Warfare and Weapons Department; and a research project on AI-driven machine vision systems that's part of a group of studies being funded by the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and a National Science Foundation initiative on semiconductors.\nAn NSF spokeswoman said that, while the agency can't comment on individual cases, 'we recognize that there exist efforts to lure US researchers and organizations into situations in which they are, potentially unknowingly, failing to comply with federal requirements.' She said the NSF 'will continue to track and mitigate risks of undue malign foreign influence on the US scientific enterprise.'\nAn Office of Naval Research spokesman said that, at the time the researcher in question made their proposal to the Pentagon agency, the person hadn't yet received the Huawei-funded prize. In addition, that researcher's university \u2014 Vanderbilt \u2014 decided to proactively fund the proposal that had been awarded by Optica shortly after Huawei's involvement in the competition became public and before Optica decided to return the company's money, according to the Optica spokesman.\nVanderbilt University said that it made the decision to return the funds to the foundation after it learned that Huawei was the competition's financial sponsor. 'We take seriously the federal government's restrictions on Huawei because of national security concerns,' the university said in a statement.\nDARPA, a Pentagon arm famous for helping develop the internet and stealth technology, in 2021 launched a program to assess the risk of foreign influence on grant awardees. A spokeswoman said it's based on both volunteered and public information.\nLongtime Relationship\nHuawei and Optica began building a relationship years before agreeing on plans for Huawei to anonymously sponsor the research competition. At the March 2022 board meeting when Optica Foundation directors approved that arrangement, Rogan said Optica and Huawei had worked together for 'decades' and that Huawei employees participate in peer reviews for Optica's scientific journals and in planning a major conference managed by the group, according to meeting minutes.\nWhen asked to provide additional information about the origins of the Huawei partnership, the Optica spokesman said Rogan and staff visited the company's headquarters in 2007 and that Rogan got to know the Huawei executive who was a judge for the research competition through their work together on conferences over the years.\nRogan's earlier trip to China would have been five years before the 2012 publication of a seminal report by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence alleging that Huawei posed significant national security threats.\nHuawei has also 'provided financial sponsorship for several events,' the minutes say, including an environmental initiative co-founded by Optica that has as its co-chair a US government chemist with the National Institute of Standards and Technology. The program, called the Global Environmental Measurement and Monitoring Initiative, or GEMM, doesn't mention Huawei on its website.\nA spokesman for NIST said its scientist 'has not received funding from GEMM beyond meeting travel expenses and was unaware of any connection between GEMM and Huawei.'\nThe Optica spokesman said Huawei 'made a one-time donation to Optica in 2019 but had no decision-making involvement in how those funds were applied.' He said Optica 'chose to use the funds for a start-up program to address pervasive environmental and climate challenges.' He declined to answer questions about the value of Huawei's 2019 donation.\nAt the board meeting, the Optica Foundation's executive director said Huawei had 'offered' to fund the research competition in late 2021 and that it was 'not seeking to design the program, determine selection criteria or choose the winners,' according to the minutes. Members then voted unanimously to approve the Huawei donation, the document says.\nHuawei's Role in Contest\nUltimately, however, Huawei did play a role in choosing the contest's winners, and it secured contractual opportunities to engage with them while they conducted their research, documents show.\nHuawei participated in deliberations over who would comprise the competition's selection committee, according to a spreadsheet reviewed by Bloomberg. The document assessed credentials of 32 potential candidates and included a column labeled 'Huawei recommendation.'\nHuawei recommended eight of the 32 listed candidates, according to the document. Several, including a Huawei executive, went on to join the competition's 10-person selection committee. Huawei's representation on the panel was ended after Bloomberg's report revealing the company's role as the competition's sole funder.\nHuawei's representative was able to maintain contact with the winners, who were obligated to participate in at least two review meetings with the selection committee to 'provide updates on progress and receive advice/guidance,' according to an agreement reviewed by Bloomberg that awardees were required to sign. The document, which listed the terms and conditions of accepting the prize money, specifies that the meetings 'could occur' at three industry conferences in the US.\nAn internal Optica budget document shows that winners also had the option of delivering their final report at an event in China called the Asia Communications and Photonics Conference, known as ACP.\nA later budget document describes a plan to send five of the competition's ten winners to ACP in Beijing in 2024. The event is co-organized by Huawei and China's State Key Lab of Information Photonics and Optical Communications.\nGlenn Tiffert, a research security specialist at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, said that the obfuscated origins of the funding, the consistency of the supported research with the Chinese government's priorities, and the dissemination activities in China supported by the program such as the ACP conference, reflect the evolution of China's efforts to target overseas talent.\nThe Optica spokesman said Huawei played no part in the final selection of competition judges and that the document Bloomberg cited with the column labeled 'Huawei recommendation' was 'an initial list of volunteers for consideration.' He said Optica followed the standard process for scoring applicants by randomly assigning proposals to judges.\nHe said 'winners are expected to have review meetings with members of the Selection Committee, but at no point was there any expectation or requirement for winners to meet directly with Huawei.' He called the Huawei- and Chinese state-sponsored conference 'an opportunity for our winners to interact at a gathering of like minds.'\nUSC Scientist\nOne of the scientists Huawei wanted on the Optica competition's selection committee was a University of Southern California engineering professor it had funded nearly a decade ago: Alan Willner. In 2016, prior to many universities deciding to ban their researchers from working with Huawei, the Chinese telecom and its US unit Futurewei funded Willner through two separate research contracts valued at a total of $338,000, according to an internal Huawei document reviewed by Bloomberg.\nWillner, who became chairman of the competition's selection committee, has been a member of the US Army Science Board and of the Defense Sciences Research Council, which provided reports to the DARPA director, according to his USC bio.\nTwo junior scientists from Willner's engineering department at USC have won research funding from Huawei through the Optica competition since it began in 2022. Both of them are on a team that USC in April announced had received the DARPA grant to develop light-based computing chips as part of a four-year Pentagon-funded effort.\nUSC said in a statement it 'places the utmost importance on complying with the letter and spirit of our obligations related to the acceptance and reporting of funding.' The statement added the university is 'undertaking a thorough review of the awards made to USC researchers from the Optica Foundation.'\nWillner didn't respond to requests for comment.\n(Updates with Vanderbilt University statement after Same Scientists subheadline)\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election\nWhy BYD's Wang Chuanfu Could Be China's Version of Henry Ford\nCorporate Women's Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash\nIndependence Without Accountability: The Fed's Great Inflation Fail\nHow to Do Succession the Right Way\n\u00a92024 Bloomberg L.P.", "rights": "yahoo.com", "rank": 36, "topic": "finance", "country": "US", "language": "en", "authors": "Kate O'Keeffe", "media": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rUTbTf0nK1dBt9H0CUrNuw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/19390c5880f964e77157888402a7ef1d", "is_opinion": false, "twitter_account": "@YahooFinance", "_score": 8.356271, "_id": "334b8b81fb5b87270693e56dad21ea39"}, {"title": "Alcon's Latest Equipment Breakthrough Technologies, Unity VCS and Unity CS, Receive U.S. FDA 510(k) Clearance", "author": "Business Wire", "published_date": "2024-06-24 05:00:00", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alcon-latest-equipment-breakthrough-technologies-050000380.html", "clean_url": "yahoo.com", "excerpt": "GENEVA, June 24, 2024--Alcon's Latest Equipment Breakthrough Technologies, Unity VCS and Unity CS, Receive U.S. FDA 510(k) Clearance", "summary": "Combined vitreoretinal-cataract system (VCS) and standalone cataract system (CS) are cleared for use in the U.S.\nNew, proprietary technologies designed to deliver transformative surgical innovation\nAlcon to immediately begin collecting real-world user experience in the U.S. prior to broad commercialization in 2025\nFirst innovations to be introduced from Alcon's cutting-edge Unity portfolio of surgical equipment\nAd Hoc Announcement Pursuant to Art. 53 LR\nGENEVA, June 24, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alcon (SIX/NYSE: ALC), the global leader in eye care dedicated to helping people see brilliantly, today announced that UNITY\u00ae Vitreoretinal Cataract System (VCS) and UNITY\u00ae Cataract System (CS) have received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance.

ASCO\u2026", "summary": "CHICAGO, June 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The 2024 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), a significant event in the global oncology community, was grandly held in Chicago, USA, from May 31 to June 4, 2024. ASCO has announced the list of outstanding abstracts for 2024, which included 138 \"Excellence Awards\" and 5 \"Special Excellence Awards.\" The clinical value assessment study of Fufang E'jiao Syrup for treating cancer-related fatigue (CRF), led by Professor Xu Yun from Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, has stood out due to its high-level evidence-based design, rigorous quality control system, and high-standard research findings. The study has been honored with the \"Special Excellence Award\" in the field of pain and symptom management. This award aims to recognize the top-ranked abstract in the pain and symptom management category as determined by the Scientific Program Committee. Notably, the Fufang E'jiao Syrup Cancer-Related Fatigue Study stands as the only clinical research involving Chinese patent medicine among the five \"Special Excellence Awards.\" As the first Chinese patent medicine to secure high-quality evidence-based medical validation for the treatment of CRF, Fufang E'jiao Syrup offers a Chinese medicinal solution for global CRF management and enhances the efficacy of anti-tumor therapies.\nAt approximately 6 a.m. Beijing time on June 1, Professor Xu Yun's team, comprising Physician Gu Shanshan and Professor Sun Lingyun, attended the ASCO Annual Meeting to receive the award. Physician Gu Shanshan accepted the award on behalf of the team. ASCO President Eric P. Winer, MD, and Conquer Cancer Foundation President Howard A. Burris III, MD, extended their warm congratulations to Professor Xu Yun's team and commemorated the occasion with photographs.\nCRF Impacts Quality of Life and Overall Efficacy of Anti-Tumor Treatments in Cancer Patients\nCancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing, persistent, and subjective experience characterized by physical, emotional, or cognitive exhaustion associated with cancer or its treatment[1]. It affects up to 70% of patients with malignant tumors[2], with incidence rates soaring to 80%-90% among those undergoing radiotherapy and chemotherapy[3]. CRF substantially diminishes the daily quality of life for cancer patients, causing significant distress and potentially leading to interruptions in anti-tumor therapies, thereby compromising overall treatment efficacy. Addressing CRF has become an increasingly vital focus in cancer care. Proper diagnosis and management of CRF can enhance the quality of life for cancer patients, extend survival rates[4], and facilitate a more comprehensive recovery, enabling patients to better reintegrate into family and society.\nInternational Recognition for Fufang E'jiao Syrup CRF Research\nAt the 20th Annual Meeting of the Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) in 2023, the abstract of the Fufang E'jiao Syrup CRF research was honored with the \"Best Abstract\" award. This recognition drew significant interest from international experts, leading to in-depth discussions with Professor Xu Yun's team. Building on this success, further analysis of the research results earned the \"Special Excellence Award\" in the field of pain and symptom management at this year's ASCO Annual Meeting. This achievement aligns with the ASCO theme for the year, \"The Art and Science of Cancer Care: From Comfort to Cure.\" Upon receiving the award, Professor Xu Yun expressed her joy and honor in contributing new research to enhance the quality of life for cancer patients, offering valuable and meaningful treatment options.\nHigh-Quality Evidence from CRF Research Anticipated to Inform Guideline Revisions\nIn 2018, the National Key R&D Program titled \"Demonstration Study on Post-Market Evidence Evaluation and Mechanism of Action of Ten Major Chinese Patent Medicines and Classical Formulas for Treating Major Diseases\" was initiated under the leadership of Chief Researcher Xie Yanming from the Institute of Clinical Basic Medicine, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Within this project, the sub-study \"Clinical Value Assessment Study of Fufang E'jiao Syrup for Treating Cancer-Related Fatigue,\" was led by Professor Xu Yun from Xiyuan Hospital, in collaboration with Dong-E-E-Jiao Co., Ltd. and 29 hospitals nationwide. This study represents China's first large-scale, multi-center evidence-based medicine study on the treatment of CRF with Chinese patent medicine, supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China. Following extensive preliminary work, this prospective, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted across 29 centers nationwide. The trial officially commenced in April 2019, with the first patient enrolled in October 2019, and the final follow-up completed in May 2022, spanning three years. The study included a total of 611 CRF patients (all with moderate to severe CRF), consisting of 210 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, 201 patients with advanced colorectal cancer, and 200 patients with advanced gastric cancer. The results demonstrated that Fufang E'jiao Syrup significantly reduced the degree of CRF in patients with advanced cancer and improved their quality of life[5]. This study addresses the limitation of previous domestic CRF research, which mainly involved single-center, small-sample studies of low quality, and provides new insights for global oncology experts. This study addresses the limitations of previous domestic CRF research, which primarily involved single-center, small-sample studies of low quality, and provides new insights for global oncology experts. It showcases that Chinese medicine can provide high-quality evidence through scientifically designed, rigorously controlled large clinical trials. It is anticipated that this study will contribute to the clinical application of Fufang E'jiao Syrup for CRF treatment and support future guideline updates.\nAncient Remedy, Modern Impact: Fufang E'jiao Syrup Enhances the Global Influence of Traditional Chinese Medicine\nFufang E'jiao Syrup traces its origins to the Ming Dynasty's \"Liangyi Paste,\" as detailed in Zhang Jiebin's \"Jingyue Quanshu.\" This contemporary Chinese medicinal compound comprises five traditional Chinese medicine ingredients: Ejiao, Rehmannia, Red Ginseng, Codonopsis, and Hawthorn. Ejiao is utilized to nourish the blood, moisten dryness, and stop bleeding. Rehmannia, serving as a primary ingredient alongside Ejiao, nourishes blood and yin while replenishing essence and marrow. Red Ginseng and Codonopsis significantly boost vital energy and strengthen the spleen, while Hawthorn aids digestion, activates blood circulation, and dissolves blood stasis. Together, these ingredients enhance the traditional blood-nourishing effects of Ejiao and support the efficacy of Ejiao blocks in aiding energy transportation, collectively working to invigorate qi and nourish blood[6].\nModern pharmacological studies have demonstrated that Fufang E'jiao Syrup can promote hematopoietic function, increase levels of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and serum iron, improve bone marrow suppression, and counteract the inhibitory effects of cyclophosphamide on bone marrow hematopoiesis. Additionally, it can elevate white blood cell counts, promote the normal division and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells, enhance immunity and the phagocytic function of macrophages, and combat fatigue[7-11]. Clinically, Fufang E'jiao Syrup is used to treat various types of anemia, including postpartum anemia, tumor-related anemia, and renal anemia. It also holds significant therapeutic value in treating bone marrow suppression post-tumor radiotherapy and chemotherapy, ovulatory dysfunction infertility in gynecology and obstetrics, and premature ovarian failure. Following the results of the Fufang E'jiao Syrup CRF study, the Chinese Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine issued the \"Expert Consensus on the Clinical Application of Fufang E'jiao Syrup for Treating Cancer-Related Fatigue with Qi and Blood Deficiency Syndrome,\" providing a valuable reference for clinicians.\nThe attainment of international awards underscores the enhanced global recognition of the evidence-based value of traditional Chinese medicine, validating that Fufang E'jiao Syrup is the first Chinese medicine to provide high-quality evidence for treating CRF. Dong-E-E-Jiao will continue to build on the evidence-based foundation of Fufang E'jiao Syrup, leveraging ancient formulas for modern applications, thereby benefiting more patients worldwide.\nReferences\n[1].

Manufacturers including Huaqin Technology, Wingtech Technology and Luxshare Precision have established automotive electronics divisions or joint ventures to find new business growth space in the field of automotive electronics.It takes some time to build up resources required to switch the role from consumer electronics to automotive electronics, and it is unlikely to directly enter the supply of core automotive parts. Therefore most manufacturers that have just begun to dabble in automotive electronics have started with products with low added value and low technical threshold.Luxshare Precision stepped into the automotive market as early as 2008 by supplying USB cables to Delphi. After entering the automotive market, it proposed the parallel development strategy of 'endogenous growth and epitaxial growth', and has become a Tier 1 supplier of auto parts by way of investment, mergers and acquisitions and self-development.\nIn 2011, Luxshare Precision established Luxshare Precision Industry (Kunshan) Co., Ltd., first developing components businesses like automotive connectors and wiring harnesses; in 2012, Luxshare Precision acquired Fujian JK Wiring Systems Co., Ltd., thereby forging into the automotive connector field, and entered the supply chain of Denso; in 2013, Luxshare Precision further expanded its product lines and customer network and entered the supply chains of German automakers by acquiring Germany's SUK (SUK is a core supplier of plastic parts for door locks of BMW and Mercedes-Benz).The success in the automotive wiring harness and connector product lines has helped Luxshare Precision to expand other automotive products, and has also offered great assistance for it in intelligent cockpit, intelligent driving and other product lines. In recent years, Luxshare Precision has made a gradual expansion from conventional vehicles to new energy vehicles, for example, it collaborated with RoboSense for a foray into the LiDAR market, and teamed up with Chery to enter the vehicle ODM field.Luxshare Precision's domain controller business mainly adopts OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and JDM (joint design manufacturer) models, with development ideas similar to consumer electronics. In addition, Luxshare Precision dabbles in other automotive products similar to consumer electronics such as wireless charging by partnering with its major clients.The competitive edges of automotive electronics OEMs: large-scale delivery experience + vertical integration capability.For manufacturers that enter the automotive electronics OEM field from different industries or fields, their original genes determine their competitive edges in the field\nFor automotive Tier 1 suppliers that are engaged in hardware OEM business, their know-how and product R&D capabilities in the automotive industry are their competitive edges that differentiate them from consumer electronics OEM giants.At present, mainstream automakers in China attach ever more importance to companies with experience in consumer electronics when selecting supply chain partners. In particular, the entry of conventional consumer electronics OEM giants has significantly lowered the hardware design and production threshold of auto parts.These consumer electronics EMS providers with years of efforts have built up rapid iteration capabilities, developed a sense of cost control, gained an edge in supply chain system, and had quick response capabilities and understanding of the ecosystem in consumer electronics. They can well help OEMs to promote and apply new products and new technologies.The large-scale delivery experience and vertical integration capability are more in favor of manufacturers to secure automotive electronics OEM orders. Moreover the capabilities of supply chain management, quality and cost control, localized quick response, and technology development are all the focus of attention from customers in the automotive industry chain.The growth trend of automotive electronics OEMs: develop from assembly and OEM to high value-added R&D and design links.In recent two years, the price war in the Chinese automotive industry has become increasingly fierce, and OEMs have very extremely controlled and squeezed their costs. For OEMs engaged in automotive electronics assembly and processing, their profit margins will be very limited if they only act as hardware OEMs. As seen in the comparison of gross margin of automotive business between some OEMs in 2022 and 2023, the gross margin of each company's automotive business showed a downward trend in 2023.For a higher profit margin, some OEMs have worked to develop their product design and R&D capabilities after improving their manufacturing capabilities. They have moved up to the solution design link and even provided overall solutions, thereby gaining more businesses and a say. Because more capabilities are required, they also enjoy a higher gross margin than those which are engaged in OEM business only. Conventional consumer electronics EMS providers such as Flextronics, Quanta, Foxconn, and Luxshare Precision do not stopped at OEM business when making deployments in the intelligent vehicle segment. Instead they improve capabilities and proportion of self-development, and even build in-depth cooperation with automakers.Key Topics Covered: Chapter 1 Overview of Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Industry1.1 Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Model and Development Trends1.1.1 Emergence of Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS1.1.2 Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Model1.1.3 Development Trends of Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Model1.1.4 Purchasing and Processing Methods of Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Companies1.2 The Automotive Electronics Market Brings New Opportunities to the EMS Industry1.2.1 Global Mobile Phone Shipments and Market Share, 20231.2.2 The Automotive Electronics Market Has Become A Breakthrough for Consumer Electronics EMS Providers1.2.3 EMS Providers Have Started Entry into the Automotive Field and Deploy Automotive Electronics1.3 Automotive Tier 1 Suppliers Start OEM/ODM/EMS Business1.4 Summary of Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Companies and Their Layout StrategiesChapter 2 Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS (by Product)2.1 Domain controller OEM/ODM/EMS2.2 LiDAR OEM/ODM/EMS2.3 Skateboard Chassis OEM/ODM/EMS2.4 Automotive Seat Components OEM/ODM/EMS2.5 Vehicle Display Assembly OEM/ODM/EMS2.6 Vehicle OEM/ODM/EMS2.7 Vehicle Communication Module OEM/ODM/EMS2.8 EIC System OEM/ODM/EMS2.9 Automotive Electronics PCBA OEM/ODM/EMS2.10 Vehicle Wireless Charging Module OEM/ODM/EMSChapter 3 Key Points of Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS3.1 Growth Paths of Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Companies3.2 Competitive Edges of Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Companies3.3 Production Barriers to Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS (by Segment)3.4 Comparison of Revenue and Gross Profit between Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS CompaniesChapter 4 Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Companies - EMS Providers Transforming from Other Industries4.1 Foxconn4.2 Quanta4.3 Pegatron4.4 Wistron4.5 Flextronics4.6 Universal Scientific Industrial (USI)4.7 PRIME Technology4.8 Luxshare Precision4.9 BYD Electronics4.10 DBG Technology4.11 Sunny Optical4.12 IMI4.13 MAXWAY4.14 Longtech4.15 Jabil4.16 Compal4.17 Inventec4.18 Wingtech Technology4.19 Huaqin TechnologyChapter 5 Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Companies - Manufacturers Focusing on Automotive OEM/ODM/EMS5.1 Wieson Automotive5.2 Maruhi Electronics5.3 MagnaChapter 6 Automotive Electronics OEM/ODM/EMS Companies - Tier 1 Suppliers Engaged in OEM/ODM/EMS Business6.1 Desay SV6.2 Hytera6.3 PATEO CONNECT+6.4 Foryou Corporation6.5 Joyson Electronic6.6 Hangsheng Electronics\nFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/wqxb2i\nAbout ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

Thurmond, Ph.D., director of the Arthur Riggs Diabetes & Metabolism Research Institute and Chan Soon-Shiong Shapiro Distinguished Chair in Diabetes. \"City of Hope research speaks to our legacy of excellence in breakthrough diabetes science and our current research focus on islet cells, which are the crux of insulin production in diabetes.\"\nReducing Hypoglycemic Episodes\nLow blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, is managed by the release of a hormone called glucagon from pancreatic alpha cells. However, for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), these cells are dysfunctional, leading to a loss of the ability to defend against low blood sugar, which can be life-threatening.\nJulia Panzer, Ph.D., a staff scientist in the lab of Alberto Pugliese, M.D., City of Hope's Samuel Rahbar Chair in Diabetes & Drug Discovery, chair of the Department of Diabetes Immunology and director of The Wanek Family Project for Type 1 Diabetes within the Arthur Riggs Diabetes & Metabolism Research Institute, explored how to restore proper alpha cell function in T1D.\nPanzer presented the team's findings from experiments using isolated islets and pancreatic tissue slices from both nondiabetic organ donors and donors with T1D. The study indicated that alpha cells respond very differently to glucose levels compared to beta cells. Furthermore, they are highly dependent on signals released from their neighboring cells.\n\"Alpha cells require inhibitory signals as a reset to function properly,\" Panzer said. \"When beta cells are lost, as observed in type 1 diabetes, the alpha cells become dysfunctional. We found that by restoring these inhibitory signals, we can reactivate the alpha cell and restore their function.\"\nShe said the findings emphasize the critical role of alpha cells, which have long been neglected, and could significantly impact patients with T1D by reducing life-threatening hypoglycemic episodes. The team found that restoring alpha cell responses can be achieved by reactivating glucagon secretion through pharmacological receptor manipulation and plans to initiate a clinical trial using Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs to do just that.\n\"To develop effective treatments for diabetes, we need to understand the complex interactions and signals among all the different cell types within the islet, not just the beta cells,\" Panzer said. \"This research highlights the importance of the interactions among individual cells within the islet, demonstrating that their collective function is essential for overall islet health.\"\nGender Differences in Diabetes Susceptibility\nWorldwide, millions more men have diabetes than women. Biological sex is an important factor that affects beta cell physiology independent of insulin sensitivity in adults and also affects beta cell function differentially with aging. Researchers have found that one potential reason is that resilience to cellular stress in beta cells is different between male and female animal models.\nTo test beta cell response to one particular type of cellular stress called endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, Yingfeng Deng, Ph.D., assistant professor in City of Hope's Department of Diabetes & Cancer Metabolism, and a group of researchers investigated something called the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is activated by beta cells to resolve ER stress.\nDeng reported that when a protein that helps activate UPR was removed from mouse models, the female mice retained normal blood sugar levels while male mice developed early onset diabetes. They also confirmed that the protein plays a role in the early development of pancreatic islets in young mice.\n\"If we can relay our findings in animal models to humans, it indicates a candidate gene has been identified by us to understand the molecular mechanism of the differential risk for diabetes in men and women,\" said Deng. \"This information will help screen for the causes of diabetes in patients according to their biological sex.\"\nShe said that while the UPR had been previously identified as a mechanism for better resilience to ER stress in beta cells of females, the significance of UPR in beta cell biology remains largely unexplored in the postnatal period when male and female differences have not fully unfolded, and beta cells are still immature.\n\"Our study fills this gap by demonstrating that while a specific UPR-activating protein is critical for beta cell function in both postnatal and adult states, it is indispensable to males, but females can stay healthy without it,\" said Deng. \"Males appear to be less tolerant to the disruption of UPR when it comes to diabetogenesis.\"\nA New Target for Improving Glucose Control\nLearning more about how molecular mechanisms in the body regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and help beta cells grow is essential to developing new approaches to diabetes therapies. Recently, researchers in the labs of Thurmond and Adolfo Garcia-Oca\u00f1a, Ph.D., City of Hope's Ruth B. and Robert K. Lanman Chair in Gene Regulation & Drug Discovery Research and chair of the Department of Molecular & Cellular Endocrinology, showed that a novel gene called zinc finger protein 385D, ZNF385D, is specifically expressed in human beta cells, but they were unsure of its role.\nAccording to Geming Lu, M.D., a City of Hope assistant research professor working in Garcia-Oca\u00f1a's lab, the team has now found that ZNF385D has a negative impact in beta cells because it decreases insulin expression and secretion. ZNF385D plays an active role in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and can be therapeutically targeted.\n\"Treatment approaches to reduce ZNF385D levels in human beta cells can normalize blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes,\" Lu said. \"Therefore, developing strategies towards this goal could improve the life of the millions of patients with T2D.\"\nThe researchers used single cell RNA-sequencing data from human islets of nondiabetic and T2D donors to analyze the relationship between ZNF385D and glucose control and beta cell survival. Expression of the gene significantly enhanced beta cell death and features of diabetes.\n\"Since diabetes results from insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production to reduce blood glucose levels, efforts to modulate ZNF385D to stop its detrimental effects will be explored for the development of new treatments for T2D,\" Lu said.\nImaging Functional Beta Cells for Better Decision Making\nOne of the major obstacles in translating successful animal studies of diabetes therapies to people with T1D is the inability to detect functional beta cells in the body. Restoring function in beta cells, which are insulin-producing cells found in pancreatic islets, is the key to effective treatments. But taking a biopsy from the pancreas is currently the only way to assess beta cells and the procedure carries too high a risk to justify its use.\nNow, Junfeng Li, Ph.D., assistant research professor in City of Hope's Department of Translational Research & Cellular Therapeutics, believes that he has found a workaround to detecting beta cell function that could aid in early therapeutic development and clinical decision-making for T1D patients.\nLi reported on findings from study by a team of City of Hope researchers that used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to track a zinc ion called Zn2+ that is an excellent biomarker of beta cell insulin release in the body. By using a highly specific fluorine 18 radiotracer (small amounts of radioactive materials used in PET scans), the researchers demonstrated that PET imaging could efficiently detect Zn2+ being released from beta cells, which reflects a capacity for insulin secretion.\n\"To our knowledge, this is the first report utilizing a fluorine 18-labeled zinc PET probe for detecting functional beta cells,\" said Li. \"Our initial results showed that this technology could be valuable for tracking in vivo beta cell function in future T1D treatment strategies.\"\nHe said that further validation studies are ongoing, but if clear visualizations of functional beta cells in the pancreas are observed, it could significantly benefit clinical decision-making regarding treatment assignment or adaptation for advancing diabetic therapies.\n\"Reliably detecting functional beta cells directly is imperative to demonstrating therapy efficacy in humans,\" Li said. \"PET imaging technology shows great promise as a tool to advance and validate T1D treatment strategies for clinical application or integration into clinical processes in humans.\"\nThe Wanek Family Project for Type One Diabetes supported this research.\nThe Importance of Cholesterol in Islets\nWhile cholesterol often gets a bad reputation for clogging arteries, it is also necessary for building and repairing cells, including islets. In fact, Wilma Tixi, Ph.D., a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Ben Shih, Ph.D., associate professor in City of Hope's Department of Translational Research & Cellular Therapeutics, announced that she, along with Shih and a team of researchers from the department, recently discovered that cholesterol production is essential for keeping the structure and function of pancreatic islets intact.\nMore specifically, the researchers found that functionality and clustering of islets \u2014 needed to regulate glucose and insulin \u2014 depends on strong cellular junctions. Furthermore, a cell adhesion protein called alpha-catenin is critical to the structural integrity of a particular type of junction, called a tight junction, and relies on cholesterol to do its job.\n\"The connection between cell adhesion and cholesterol production is crucial for the health of pancreatic islets,\" said Tixi. \"Targeting cholesterol synthesis in these cell connections could lead to new treatments that improve how pancreatic islets work, offering better options for managing diabetes.\"\nThe findings could help improve stem cell techniques and advance beta cell replacement therapies for diabetes and point to a new focus for therapeutic research.\nAbout City of Hope\nCity of Hope's mission is to make hope a reality for all touched by cancer and diabetes.

By leveraging NLP to analyze vast amounts of unstructured medical data and using Knowledge Graphs to map complex relationships, researchers can gain deeper insights into the opioid crisis. These advanced technologies enable more effective data integration, pattern recognition, and predictive analytics, ultimately contributing to better understanding, prevention, and treatment strategies for opioid addiction.\nThe opioid crisis is a devastating public health emergency affecting millions of people worldwide. Characterized by widespread misuse of prescription opioids, heroin, and synthetic opioids like fentanyl, the crisis has led to unprecedented rates of addiction, overdose, and death. The complexity and scale of the epidemic demand innovative research approaches to uncover new insights and develop effective interventions.\nUsing NLP and knowledge graphs have emerged as powerful tools in the battle against the opioid crisis. By harnessing these cutting-edge technologies, researchers can unlock a wealth of information buried within vast repositories of unstructured data, such as scientific literature, clinical notes, medical reports, and social media discussions.\nNLP techniques allow for the extraction of structured information from these unstructured sources, enabling the identification of entities like drugs, diseases, and adverse events, as well as the relationships between them. This capability is particularly valuable in the context of opioid research, where understanding the complex relationships between various factors is crucial.\nKnowledge graphs, on the other hand, provide a powerful framework for integrating and representing diverse data types, including the structured information extracted through NLP. By modeling the intricate relationships between entities, knowledge graphs enable researchers to perform advanced querying, reasoning, and knowledge discovery, unveiling insights that might remain hidden in siloed datasets.\nNeo4j is used to analyze the connected data in ways not possible without graphs. Neo4j is a native graph database specifically designed to store and process connected data, which helps solve complicated life sciences problems at every scale.\nThe combination of NLP and knowledge graphs holds the promise of revolutionizing opioid research by facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted factors contributing to addiction, identifying potential risk factors, and ultimately informing the development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies.\nThis post covers using pretrained models in the Healthcare NLP library from John Snow Labs to extract entities related to opioids and their adverse effects and then building knowledge graphs by using Neo4J that represents complex relationships between opioid drugs, symptoms, and research publications. By representing entities like opioid drugs, associated conditions (effects), and related PubMed publications as nodes, and their relationships as edges, Neo4j can uncover insights into the adverse effects of opioids, and the PubMed articles those drugs and conditions are mentioned. Overall, Neo4j's capability to handle highly connected data makes it a valuable tool for various healthcare use cases, from knowledge management to operational analytics and decision support.\nLet us start with a short Spark NLP introduction and then discuss the details of opioid drugs analysis with some solid results. Spark NLP & LLM\nThe Healthcare Library is a powerful component of John Snow Labs' Spark NLP platform, designed to facilitate NLP tasks within the healthcare domain. This library provides over 2,200 pre-trained models and pipelines tailored for medical data, enabling accurate information extraction, NER for clinical and medical concepts, and text analysis capabilities. Regularly updated and built with cutting-edge algorithms, the Healthcare library aims to streamline information processing and empower healthcare professionals with deeper insights from unstructured medical data sources, such as electronic health records, clinical notes, and biomedical literature.\nJohn Snow Labs' GitHub repository serves as a collaborative platform where users can access open-source resources, including code samples, tutorials, and projects, to further enhance their understanding and utilization of Spark NLP and related tools.\nJohn Snow Labs also offers periodic certification training to help users gain expertise in utilizing the Healthcare Library and other components of their NLP platform.\nJohn Snow Labs' demo page provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the capabilities of the library, allowing users to interactively test and visualize various functionalities and models, facilitating a deeper understanding of how these tools can be applied to real-world scenarios in healthcare and other domains. Reason for Opioid Research\nThe opioid epidemic has been a devastating public health crisis, claiming countless lives and causing immeasurable suffering. As the fight against this crisis intensifies, researchers and healthcare professionals are exploring innovative approaches to gain deeper insights and develop more effective strategies to combat opioid addiction and its far-reaching consequences.\nThe graph below (produced by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)) paints a grim picture, with the total number of deaths sharply rising from relatively low levels in the late 1990s to an alarming peak of over 81,000 deaths in 2022. The graph's distinct lines for males and females reveal the disproportionate impact on the male population, although both genders have experienced a substantial increase in opioid-related fatalities over the years. https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates Extracting Oncology-Related Entities from Clinical Notes\nThe extraction of opioid-related information from unstructured text data using Named Entity Recognition (NER) models or Large Language Models (LLMs) is the critical step in the analysis. Unstructured data sources, such as electronic health records (EHRs), clinical notes, and medical literature, hold extensive amounts of valuable information but present significant challenges due to their lack of structured format. NER models are specifically trained to address these challenges by identifying and classifying entities within the text into predefined categories (labeling).\nIn the context of opioid research, NER models are trained to recognize and extract entities related to opioid drugs, such as specific medication names (e.g., oxycodone, fentanyl), patient symptoms associated with opioid use (e.g., respiratory depression, constipation), and other critical medical terms (e.g., diagnoses, treatments, comorbidities). Advanced NER models, especially those based on deep learning techniques and LLMs utilize sophisticated algorithms to understand the context and semantics of the text, significantly improving the accuracy of entity recognition.\nUsing Relation Extraction for establishing relationships between named entities efficiently handles large volumes of unstructured text data, converting it into structured information with recognized entities and their relationships.\nAfter the successful extraction of relevant opioid-related entities from unstructured data, the next crucial step is to establish relationships between these entities. This is where Knowledge Graphs come into play. Knowledge Graphs organize the extracted data into a structured format, mapping out the relationships between different entities in a network-like structure. For example, a Knowledge Graph can link a specific opioid medication to its potential side effects, correlate patient symptoms to particular opioid prescriptions, and highlight interactions between opioids and other drugs the patient may be taking.\nThe process starts with the NER model extracting entities from text data. For instance, from a clinical note stating, 'The patient was prescribed oxycodone for chronic pain but developed severe constipation and respiratory depression,' the NER model would identify 'oxycodone,' 'chronic pain,' 'constipation,' and 'respiratory depression' as entities. Subsequently, the Knowledge Graph would establish relationships such as caused_by between 'alfentanil' and 'neonatal respiratory distress' and caused_by between 'oxycodone' and 'constipation' and 'respiratory depression.'\nThis integrated approach not only enhances data analysis but also facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the complex interdependencies in opioid research. By leveraging NER models for entity extraction plus the relation extraction for establishing the relations between the entities (nodes), and then using Knowledge Graphs for relationship mapping, researchers can uncover hidden patterns, predict potential health outcomes, and develop targeted interventions. This methodology represents a significant advancement in addressing the opioid crisis, providing deeper insights and more effective strategies for prevention, treatment, and policy-making in the realm of opioid use and its associated impacts.\nInformation Extraction from Text\nThe ability to quickly visualize the entities generated using the Healthcare NLP library's NER models is a very useful feature for examining the generated results. Spark NLP Display is an open-source Python library for visualizing the extracted and labeled entities generated with Spark NLP. NerVisualizer highlights the extracted named entities and also displays their labels as decorations on top of the analyzed text.\nIn the example below, the model (ner_opioid), specifically trained for extracting entities related to opioids, identified two opioid medications: Oxycodone, prescribed for chronic pain, and Fentanyl patch, used for breakthrough pain. The visualizer labeled non-opioid medications: Metformin for diabetes management and Lisinopril for hypertension. Medications were clearly categorized medications by type (OPIOID_DRUG and OTHER_DRUG) Also, the intended uses or associated conditions (GENERAL_SYMPTOMS, OTHER_DISEASE) were also extracted and labeled.\nThe Relation Extraction Visualizer provides a comprehensive overview of a (hypothetical) 42-year-old male patient's medical history and current condition as an example, with a focus on opioid use. It highlights the patient's chief complaints of chronic and breakthrough pain, linking these to his of chronic pain management with opioid analgesics. The diagram details the patient's past medical history, including hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and outlines his current medication regimen. This visual representation effectively captures the complex relationships between the patient's symptoms, medical history, and medication use, providing valuable insights into potential opioid-related complications and areas requiring further medical attention.\nCypher is Neo4j's graph query language that lets you retrieve data from the graph and it is similar to SQL for graphs. It is the easiest graph language to learn by far because of its similarity to other languages and intuitiveness.\nIn the following example, the query retrieves all nodes and their relationships, providing a complete picture of all the nodes \u2014 opioids, conditions, and PubMed article IDs.\nThis representation is useful for identifying clusters, outliers, and patterns within the data. Dense areas indicate high connectivity and interaction among nodes, suggesting areas of extensive research or highly referenced topics. Sparse areas or isolated nodes may indicate less researched or niche topics.\nSuch visualizations are valuable in research for identifying key areas of study, potential gaps in research and the overall structure of data relationships. They aid in understanding the interconnected nature of medical conditions, drug references, and scholarly articles.\nThe visualization below offers a more detailed look at the network of nodes and relationships, showing a comprehensive mapping of the data. Alfentanil is a synthetic, short-acting opioid analgesic classified as a small-molecule derivative of fentanyl.\nThe central node, alfentanil, is connected to various conditions and articles. Relationships like caused_by highlight medical conditions potentially caused by alfentanil.\nThe dense network of article_of and mentioned_in indicates the extensive research and references available for the entities in this dataset.\nThis visualization focuses on the relationships between a respiratory condition and various opioid drugs that may cause or be associated with it.\nFor example, nodes labeled hydrocodone, fentanyl citrate, duragesic, codeine, and oxycodone could be opioid analgesics or other substances that potentially cause, exacerbate or are linked to the respiratory condition in some way.\nThe results overview on the right shows that there are 27 nodes in total, with 10 condition nodes, 17 opioid nodes, and 25 caused_by relationships.\nIn the example below, a query is run on the database to identify which opioids have the most similar conditions.\nThe query returns pairs of opioids with their shared conditions. For example, Morphine and MS Contin share conditions like chronic pain disease and cognitive decline. On the other hand, Dolophine and Methadone share conditions such as cognitive dysfunction and anxiety symptoms.\nThis approach can guide healthcare professionals in understanding the shared side effects and therapeutic uses. Also, it may be helpful in the prediction of the side effects of drugs based on shared conditions. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the combination of NLP and Knowledge Graphs offers a powerful approach to accelerate and enhance opioid research. By efficiently extracting, organizing, and connecting vast amounts of biomedical information, these technologies enable researchers to: Uncover hidden relationships between drugs, side effects, and biological pathways Identify potential new targets for pain management Predict and mitigate adverse drug interactions Analyze patterns in prescription practices and patient outcomes\nAs the opioid crisis continues to pose significant challenges to public health, leveraging these advanced computational techniques becomes increasingly crucial. They not only streamline the research process but also provide novel insights that may lead to safer and more effective pain management strategies.\nThe integration of NLP and Knowledge Graphs in opioid research represents a significant step forward in our ability to tackle this complex issue. As these technologies continue to evolve, they promise to play an even greater role in shaping evidence-based policies, developing innovative treatments, and ultimately improving patient care in the field of pain management.\nP.S.

(OTC: VAXX), a U.S. company pioneering the development of a new class of medicines known as AIMs (active immunotherapy medicines), announced today that Nature Medicine has published groundbreaking exploratory data from the Company's Phase 1 clinical trial of UB-312 in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The successful trial included measures of clinical efficacy, as well as exploratory research funded by The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF) assessing target engagement in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic and UTHealth Houston.\nUB-312-induced antibodies significantly decreased levels of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1Syn), a key pathology in PD and other synucleinopathies, as measured by a semi-quantitative seed amplification assay (SAA). This suggests that UB-312 can help to eliminate the buildup of harmful, toxic forms of the protein \u03b1Syn in the brain. Patients with detectable UB-312-induced antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exhibited significant improvement in motor experiences of daily living as measured by the MDS-UPDRS Part II, a commonly accepted clinical scale. This marks a potentially significant milestone in the pursuit of innovative PD care. The Phase 1 successfully met its primary outcome measures, demonstrating UB-312 was generally well-tolerated and induced anti-\u03b1Syn antibody responses in healthy volunteers and PD patients. 12 out of 13 PD patients who completed dosing developed anti-\u03b1Syn antibodies.\n'The publication of this data in Nature Medicine immortalizes the profound impact of UB-312, leading the charge against the very core of Parkinson's,' added Lou Reese, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of Vaxxinity. 'It sparks a beacon of hope and anticipation for a future where Parkinson's no longer determines the trajectory of lives. This is more than just a scientific breakthrough; it's a battle cry for change, declaring that the status quo in Parkinson's care is no longer acceptable.\"\nParkinson's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative condition, currently lacks an approved disease-modifying treatment. Alpha-synuclein, a key protein in PD pathology, forms aggregates known as Lewy bodies that contribute to neuronal degeneration. UB-312 is designed to stimulate a targeted immune response against pathological forms of \u03b1Syn.\nNotable highlights from the exploratory Phase 1 data published in Nature Medicine include:\nTwo exploratory CSF biomarkers show promise as measures of target engagement.\naggregated \u03b1Syn, as measured by an SAA\nphosphorylated \u03b1Syn (pS129-\u03b1Syn)\nPD patients with UB-312-induced antibodies in CSF had significantly less \u03b1Syn aggregation (p <0.01) and pS129-\u03b1Syn (p <0.05) compared to patients without detectable CSF antibody titers.\nPD patients with UB-312-induced antibodies in CSF showed significant improvement in the MDS-UPDRS Part II motor experiences of daily living compared to patients without detectable CSF antibody titers (p<0.05).\nIn vitro, UB-312-induced antibodies preferentially bind to aggregated forms of \u03b1Syn as measured by dot blot, and slow the aggregation of \u03b1Syn as measured by seed amplification.\n'UB-312 has the potential to become an important and potent disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson's disease. It would be truly amazing if we could vaccinate people against Parkinson's disease in the future!' says Professor Geert Jan Groeneveld, neurologist and principal investigator of the Phase 1 clinical trial performed at the Centre for Human Drug Research in Leiden, the Netherlands.\nThe publication in Nature Medicine follows the completion of Part B of the Phase 1 clinical trial, which involved 20 patients with early PD (Hoehn & Yahr stage \u2264 III) dosed with one of two priming regimens of UB-312 or placebo, and followed for 24 weeks of observation. Vaxxinity plans to continue its research and development efforts to advance UB-312 as candidate for PD. Results from Part A of the trial in 50 healthy volunteers, aged 40 to 85 years, were published in Movement Disorders in 2022 (Yu et al.). The exploratory biomarker and target engagement research portion of the trial was funded by The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF), and marked a two-year collaborative project between Vaxxinity, the Mayo Clinic, and UTHealth Houston to analyze CSF collected from patients.\nAbout UB-312UB-312 is an AIM designed to slow or stop Parkinson's progression by addressing the root cause of the disease. In the first patient trial, it safely induced antibodies against toxic alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) aggregates, representing a potential disease-modifying therapy. It is the first active immunotherapy to demonstrate target engagement in patient CSF using the \u03b1Syn seed amplification assay.\nAbout VaxxinityVaxxinity, Inc. is a purpose-driven biotechnology company committed to democratizing healthcare across the globe.

addressing all these un other underlying medical conditions which make the drugs even better.\nSo I think it's very hard to kind of predict either name from a, a valuation standpoint alone.\nBut I do think the news flow over the next 6 to 12 months and even into next year um are gonna be potentially prolific because we're gonna be talking about more and more indications that the drugs satisfy with that in mind.\nI mean, investors are always looking at the health care space for the the next major breakthrough or scientific advancement.\nWhat is that beyond G LP ones at this juncture and is it, is it clear which company is pioneering that it's not really clear at all?\nI mean, I think in some respect, the next, you know, innovation wave could still come as a result of the G LP one class because both companies are looking at their technology for use in neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.\nAnd we're gonna have data on that um roughly a year from now, maybe a little bit later than a year from now.\nSo as I kind of like look across the complex in BioPharma, the G LP one still might be, you know, the center of innovation in terms of like what you're talking about the next leg or you know, the next exciting area because outside of this, I just don't see market opportunities when we talk about dollar or revenue opportunities being anywhere near as significant as what these are gonna do.\nSo Jared when it comes to, I guess the potential here as to be the catalyst then for other names within the industry, we spend so much time and rightfully so over the last 6, 12 months, I'm sure for you a lot longer talking about, we're placing a lot of the emphasis on Eli Lilly and Anna Novo Nordis.\nAre those the two top plays within the sector?\nOr are there other names that maybe investors should be taking a look at here that could kind of ride the the coat tail, so to speak and also uh get a boost from some of this D LP one excitement.\nWell, yeah, I mean, I think for me, Novo and Lily are still gonna be the top two, you know, as long as they're dominating in, in this kind of section of the market, um it's really tough to, you know, not ride these a little bit longer.\nUm As far as other players in the G LP one market that might emerge that are of interest or intrigue to investors.\nI think we're still trying to understand from Amgen, what their monthly G LP One data is going to look like that's gonna be available sometime this year.\nNot precisely sure when, but they're looking at, you know, the use of the weight loss drug on a monthly basis that's versus Lilian Novo um weekly.\nSo that's one to kind of watch out for.\nI mean, I've been pretty bullish on Merck all year given valuation, given the fact that they seem to be doing a lot of smart things from a business development standpoint to kind of dilute the effect of Kruta losing patent exclusivity closer to 2030.\nThat's been the big concern that, you know, the lion's share of their revenue is going away, but they've done a lot of smart things in terms of um acquisitions and otherwise to kind of make sure that that erosion is not as extreme.\nUm And I think astrazeneca is probably fourth.\nSo I think astra and Merck as kind of like still very solid quality names in Pharma that you can play.\nUm They don't have huge GOP one exposure, but I think Amgen is gonna be interesting.\nI, I don't have a strong view on it.\nWe really haven't seen a lot of data companies seem super bullish on it.\nUm You know, that could be one clearly worth watching into the second half.", "rights": "yahoo.com", "rank": 36, "topic": "science", "country": "US", "language": "en", "authors": "Brad Smith,Seana Smith", "media":

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\nCNN \u2014\nAn 81-year-old politician faces a combination of admiration and ridicule as he embarks on his pivotal, decisive chapter. He moves more slowly, speaks more softly, but his mind remains sharp and his moxie intact.\nThe politician is not President Joe Biden, but Benjamin Franklin. As an octogenarian, he was by far the oldest delegate at the Constitutional Convention. Many doubted whether Franklin was up to the task and snickered behind his back, but he proved them wrong. He contributed mightily, helping to set a tone of compromise and crafting a breakthrough that saved the day, and the young republic.\nEric Weiner\nThere is no better model for the elderly politician than Franklin. The last third of his long life (he lived until 84) was by far the most interesting, and the first two-thirds were downright fascinating.\nIt was in his closing act, a time when he could have been doing the colonial-era equivalent of golfing in Florida, that he accomplished the most and changed the most. This was when Franklin the Loyalist became Franklin the Rebel and, later, when Franklin the Enslaver became Franklin the Abolitionist. This was when he charmed the French into supporting the American cause, ensuring the revolution was a success.\nLost in the debate about how old is too old to occupy the White House is the fact that chronological age tells us little about a person. It is not how old someone is but the kind of old that matters. Are they grumpy old or sanguine old? Resigned old or bold old? Franklin was in a category unto himself. He was never president, of course, but he proved that age need not be an impediment to sage and inspired leadership.\nIt is not how old someone is but the kind of old that matters.\nEric Werner\nAt age 70, Franklin helped edit the Declaration of Independence. His most important revision appears early. Jefferson's original draft reads, 'We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal.' An assertive pen stroke \u2014 most likely Franklin's \u2014 struck through 'sacred & undeniable,' replacing it with 'self-evident.' We hold these truths to be self-evident.\nIt might seem like a minor revision, a more concise wording of the same idea, but it is much more than that. Jefferson's original wording appeals to religious authority. By revising the passage to read 'self-evident,' Franklin invoked a different and, he believed, higher authority: human reason. Franklin saw what Jefferson, less than half his age, did not.\nFranklin stayed busy, always faithful to his tenet that when it came to public positions, one should 'never ask, never refuse, nor ever resign.' He needed to remain relevant and useful. He needed to be needed. As for death, he rarely thought about it. 'It has always been my maxim to live on as if I was to live always,' he once said. 'It is with such feeling only that we can be stimulated to the exertions necessary to effect any useful purpose.'\nRecent research bears out Franklin's approach. Many people grow happier as they age, even in the face of adversity, a 2014 study published in the journal Psychology and Ageing found, provided they possess one trait: a flexible sense of self. When it comes to matters of the head and heart, Franklin was remarkably nimble, that rare person who grew more, not less, agile with each passing year. At age 69, while serving in London, he flipped from British Loyalist to American rebel. Well into his 80s he continued to change his mind about vital issues, such as slavery.\nConsider, again, the role he played at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. At 81, Franklin was old enough to be the father of all the others and the grandfather of most. When Franklin had first argued for colonial unity in 1754 (his so-called Albany Plan) at age 48, James Madison was three years old.\nFranklin suffered from many physical ailments, including gout and kidney stones, and some days he had to be carried to the convention hall on a sedan chair, but the founding grandfather's mind was as sharp as ever, honed perhaps by regular exercise, especially swimming, and playing magic squares, a kind of early sudoku he invented. Fellow convention delegate William Pierce said Franklin possessed 'an activity of mind equal to a youth of 25 years.' One visitor to the elderly Franklin's home, Manasseh Cutler, was struck by how 'his manners are perfectly easy, and everything about him seems to diffuse an unrestrained freedom and happiness.'\nIt was not all clear sailing though. Franklin's age made him the object of both veneration and ridicule. The younger delegates admired Franklin's past accomplishments but not necessarily his present contribution. Some dismissed his ideas out of hand. Others snickered behind his back. Ageism is not a 21st century invention.\nNot for the first or last time, people underestimated Franklin. While he did not play the decisive role in shaping the Constitution \u2014 that task fell to younger delegates such as James Madison and Alexander Hamilton \u2014 Franklin managed to cool heated tempers and nudge competing factions toward compromise. ' The Old Conjurer,' as John Adams dubbed him, often accomplished this by sleight-of-hand. At one point, he proposed that each session open with a prayer. The unlikely motion went nowhere but it did supply the breathing space, the pause, so desperately needed.\nDuring that sweltering Philadelphia summer of 1787, Franklin worked tirelessly, albeit quietly and behind the scenes, embodying the 17th-century jurist John Selden's dictum: 'They that govern most make (the) least noise.' Contrast that with our noisier-is-better assumption.\nWith the convention deadlocked, Franklin helped craft the Great Compromise (also known as the Connecticut Compromise). One legislative body, the House of Representatives, would be determined by population, while another, the Senate, by state \u2014 with each state having the same number of seats in the Senate. The plan, backed by Franklin, saved the day, and the infant nation.\nAt the close of the convention, with its outcome still in doubt, Franklin delivered an impassioned plea for something rarely celebrated today: doubt. Franklin doubted whether the Constitution drafted over the preceding few months was the best version possible, but he was going to sign it anyway: 'For having lived long, I have experienced many instances of being oblig'd, by better information or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on important subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise.' The older he grew, Franklin continued, the more likely he was to question his own judgment and to 'pay more Respect to the Judgment of others.'\nFranklin's message is as vital today as it was in 1787. More vital. Doubting the views of others is easy. The hard part is second-guessing your own. Doubt everything, including your own doubt, Franklin advised, and don't grow too attached to your intellectual castles. They might be built of sand. What he once said of scientific theories holds true for political ones as well. '(H)ow many pretty systems do we build, which we soon find ourselves oblig'd to destroy!'\nThe mark of a mature democracy, he observed, is not only the institutions and policies it constructs but its readiness to modify those institutions and policies to fit new circumstances. That is why Franklin referred to the new US Constitution not as a document or blueprint but as an 'instrument.' Precisely as good and useful as the character of those who wield it. That is an important observation \u2014 one that could only occur to someone who had lived a few years.", "rights": "cnn.com", "rank": 76, "topic": "news", "country": "US", "language": "en", "authors": "Opinion Eric Weiner,Eric Weiner", "media": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-512423436.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill", "is_opinion": true, "twitter_account": "@CNNOpinions", "_score": 7.2440715, "_id": "8c1d46042cd6f0e4707ec8e1cf557611"}, {"title": "Savara Announces Molgramostim Nebulizer Solution (Molgramostim) Achieved Statistical Significance for Primary Endpoint and Multiple Secondary Endpoints in IMPALA-2, a Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trial in Autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (aPAP)", "author": "Business Wire", "published_date": "2024-06-26 10:30:00", "published_date_precision": "full", "link": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/savara-announces-molgramostim-nebulizer-solution-103000328.html", "clean_url": "yahoo.com", "excerpt": "LANGHORNE, Pa., June 26, 2024--Savara Inc.

(Nasdaq: SVRA) (the Company), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare respiratory diseases, today announced positive results from the pivotal, Phase 3 IMPALA-2 clinical trial. IMPALA-2 is a 48-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of molgramostim 300 mcg administered once daily by inhalation with matching placebo in adult patients with aPAP (NCT04544293). Molgramostim is an inhaled form of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).\nThe trial met its primary endpoint. The treatment difference between molgramostim and placebo for mean change from baseline to Week 24 in hemoglobin-adjusted percent predicted DLCO achieved statistical significance. This statistically significant treatment difference was sustained at Week 48, a secondary endpoint, which demonstrated durability of effect.\nThe treatment difference between molgramostim and placebo for mean change from baseline to Week 24 in SGRQ Total Score achieved statistical significance. Two additional secondary endpoints reached nominal significance: SGRQ Activity Score at Week 24 and exercise capacity using a treadmill test at Week 48.\n\"There is a high unmet need for effective, disease-specific pharmacotherapy for autoimmune PAP,\" said Bruce Trapnell, M.D., Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and the Lead Clinical Investigator of the IMPALA-2 trial. \"Patients typically experience breathlessness, which begins slowly and progresses over time, often accompanied by cough and fatigue, and in some patients, serious infections, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure requiring lung transplantation. With convincing data from two large clinical trials, the evidence now clearly demonstrates molgramostim has the potential to be a safe and efficacious treatment option for these patients.

Exercise capacity as measured by a treadmill is a cardiorespiratory health (CRH) measurement.\nMolgramostim was well tolerated. The frequency of adverse events was generally similar between treatment groups. Two patients (2.5%) discontinued molgramostim treatment due to adverse events, both of which were considered unrelated to trial drug. The most commonly reported adverse events in the molgramostim group were COVID-19, cough, and pyrexia, with COVID-19 occurring more frequently with molgramostim than with placebo.\nIMPALA-2 Top Line Safety Results (Safety Analysis Set, n=164):\nTreatment Related Adverse Events\nMolgramostim(N=81)n (%)\nPlacebo(N=83)n (%)\nAny\n69 (85)\n71 (86)\nMost common\nCOVID-19\n18 (22)\n8 (10)\nCough\n17 (21)\n18 (22)\nPyrexia\n11 (14)\n9 (11)\nNasopharyngitis\n11 (14)\n7 (8)\nArthralgia\n9 (11)\n7 (8)\nHeadache\n9 (11)\n7 (8)\nDiarrhea\n9 (11)\n2 (2)\nAlveolar proteinosis\n4 (5)\n12 (14)\nSerious\n14 (17)\n20 (24)\nTreatment related\n20 (25)\n16 (19)\n\"The IMPALA-2 results not only met, but exceeded, our expectations, validating our hypothesis that molgramostim provides clear, durable improvement in gas exchange, and beyond that, clinical benefits that positively impact quality of life for aPAP patients,\" said Matt Pauls, Chair and CEO, Savara. \"The strong efficacy data and favorable benefit-risk profile potentially position molgramostim to be the first and only approved therapeutic for aPAP in the U.S. and Europe. We extend our gratitude to the patients and their families, clinicians, and site personnel for their contributions and ongoing participation in the largest clinical trial in aPAP. We look forward to analyzing the full data from IMPALA-2 and anticipate submitting it for presentation at a scientific conference later this year.\"\nMolgramostim has been granted Orphan Drug, Fast Track, and Breakthrough Therapy designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Orphan Drug designation from the European Medicines Agency and Innovative Passport and Promising Innovative Medicine designation from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency for the treatment of aPAP.\nConference Call\nSavara management will host a conference call and live audiovisual webcast to discuss the IMPALA-2 results at 8:00am ET today.

The trial is being conducted at 43 clinical trial sites across 16 countries in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, Australia and countries in Europe, including Turkey. The primary efficacy assessment is diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), a gas exchange measure, and the primary endpoint is change from baseline to Week 24 in percent predicted DLCO, with a secondary endpoint of change from baseline to Week 48 in percent predicted DLCO. Three additional secondary efficacy variables evaluate clinical measures of direct patient benefit: St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) Total Score, SGRQ Activity Score, and exercise capacity using a treadmill test, with each endpoint measured at Weeks 24 and 48. The primary time point for efficacy assessments is at Week 24; however, efficacy was assessed through Week 48 to evaluate durability of effect. Safety was assessed through Week 48. Pending applicable regulatory and ethics committee approvals, following the 48-week double-blind treatment period patients may continue in a 96-week open-label period and receive molgramostim 300 mcg administered once daily.\nAbout aPAP\nAutoimmune PAP is a rare lung disease characterized by the abnormal build-up of surfactant in the alveoli (or air sacs) of the lungs. Surfactant consists of proteins and lipids and is an important physiological substance that lines the alveoli to prevent them from collapsing. In a healthy lung, excess surfactant is cleared and digested by immune cells called alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophages need to be stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to function properly in clearing surfactant, but in autoimmune PAP, GM-CSF is neutralized by antibodies against GM-CSF, rendering the macrophages unable to adequately clear surfactant. As a result, an excess of surfactant accumulates in the alveoli, causing impaired gas exchange, resulting in clinical symptoms of shortness of breath, often with cough and frequent fatigue. Patients may also experience episodes of fever, chest pain, or coughing up blood, especially if secondary lung infection develops. In the long-term, the disease can lead to serious complications, including lung fibrosis and the need for a lung transplant.\nAbout Savara\nSavara is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on rare respiratory diseases.

(Nasdaq: GUTS) (the 'Company'), a metabolic therapeutics company focused on pioneering new approaches that treat the root cause of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), today announced that it will accelerate its REMAIN-1 clinical study, which is evaluating Revita's efficacy in maintaining weight loss following the discontinuation of GLP-1 therapy. The Company also announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved an amendment to the protocol for the REVITALIZE-1 study of its Revita device, which expands eligibility to patients with T2D who are inadequately controlled on any glucose lowering agent, including GLP-1 agonists and/or insulin, thus expanding the potential U.S. treatment population by nearly six-fold. Fractyl now anticipates reporting open label data from the REVEAL-1 cohort of REMAIN-1 starting in Q4 2024, a mid-point data analysis from REMAIN-1 in Q2 2025, and topline data from REVITALIZE-1 in mid-2025.\nObesity is a highly prevalent, complex disease that is associated with multiple cardiometabolic complications, including T2D. GLP-1 agonists have become game-changers in the treatment of diabetes and obesity: over 40% of patients with diabetes in the U.S. have tried GLP-1s and over 12 million U.S. adults have used them just to lose weight,1, 2 yet they are not providing patients with sustained solutions to these chronic problems. Discontinuation rates are high due to gastrointestinal side effects, cost, access challenges, and other unexplained reasons. Clinical trials have highlighted the risk of substantial weight regain \u2014 as much as 66% \u2014 within one year of discontinuing GLP-1 therapies.3, 4\nRevita is an outpatient endoscopic procedure that involves resurfacing the mucosal lining of the duodenum, the first part of the small intestine just after the stomach, which is responsible for breaking down food into absorbable nutrients. Revita targets the duodenal lining, which can become thickened by high-fat and high-sugar diets, making it hard for the body to maintain a healthy metabolism and blood glucose levels. By resurfacing and reversing the pathology of the duodenal lining, if approved, Revita has the potential to become the first disease-modifying therapy that targets a root cause of obesity and T2D.\n'We are pleased to announce the acceleration of our REMAIN-1 study to address the significant unmet need we're seeing around weight maintenance following the use of GLP-1 treatment,' said Harith Rajagopalan, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Fractyl. 'If successful and approved, Revita may offer a reliable 'off-ramp' to the millions of people currently taking GLP-1 therapies, potentially providing durable weight maintenance without having to continue taking these medications.'\nDr. Rajagopalan added, 'In parallel, we are excited about the expansion of the protocol for REVITALIZE-1, because we believe Revita holds unique potential for tackling disease progression and prevention in the huge public health crisis that is T2D. For patients currently managing T2D with medications and/or insulin, Revita aims to enhance glucose regulation and halt or slow down the disease's advancement, representing a paradigm shift in the way in which we treat these patients.'\nIn prior clinical studies of Revita conducted in people with T2D in the U.S. and EU, pooled analyses of weight data provided evidence to support the potential for durable weight maintenance after a single Revita procedure. Revita is approved in Germany for the treatment of T2D and has both an FDA Breakthrough Device designation in insulin-treated T2D and reimbursement support from the CMS, meaning that CMS will cover routine costs and certain trial-related expenses for participants.\nREMAIN-1 UpdateREMAIN-1 is a randomized, double-blind trial of Revita versus sham in patients who have lost at least 15% total body weight on tirzepatide therapy, which is expected to begin in Q3 2024. Given the accelerated timeline, the Company now anticipates a mid-point data analysis from this cohort in Q2 2025. In parallel to the randomized portion of the REMAIN-1 study, Fractyl will also have an open label cohort, REVEAL-1, that will follow a similar patient population and management protocol with open label data updates. The Company anticipates providing initial open label data in Q4 2024.\nREVITALIZE-1 Update REVITALIZE-1 (NCT04419779) is a randomized, double-blind crossover, sham-controlled, multi-center study of Revita. Previously, the protocol included T2D patients taking insulin and up to three non-insulin drugs, including GLP-1 therapies. The updated protocol will now include patients with inadequately controlled T2D on at least one glucose lowering agent (GLA). Fractyl will immediately begin recruiting these additional patients into REVITALIZE-1 and now expects to report topline data in mid-2025.\nREJUVA Update The Company presented new head-to-head preclinical data comparing Rejuva\u00ae, its adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based GLP-1 pancreatic gene therapy program, to semaglutide as part of a President Select Abstract at ADA's 84th Scientific Sessions in Orlando, FL. These data demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the percentage and durability of weight reductions as well as a greater relative proportion of fat mass to lean mass loss in mice treated with Rejuva vs. semaglutide.\nAbout Fractyl Health Fractyl Health is a metabolic therapeutics company focused on pioneering new approaches to the treatment of metabolic diseases, including obesity and T2D. Despite advances in treatment over the last 50 years, obesity and T2D continue to be rapidly growing drivers of morbidity and mortality in the 21st century. Fractyl Health's goal is to transform metabolic disease treatment from chronic symptomatic management to durable disease-modifying therapies that target the organ-level root causes of disease. Fractyl Health is based in Burlington, MA. For more information, visit www.fractyl.com or https://twitter.com/FractylHealth.\nAbout RevitaFractyl Health's lead product candidate, Revita, is based on the company's insights surrounding the potential role of the gut in obesity and T2D. Revita is designed to remodel the duodenal lining via hydrothermal ablation (i.e., duodenal mucosal resurfacing) to edit abnormal intestinal nutrient sensing and signaling mechanisms that are a potential root cause of metabolic disease. Revita has received a CE mark in Europe and, in January 2022, received reimbursement authorization through NUB in Germany for the treatment of T2D. In the United States, Revita is for investigational use only under US law. A pivotal study of Revita in patients with T2D who are inadequately controlled on any glucose lowering agent, REVITALIZE-1, is currently enrolling in the United States and Europe. A pivotal study of Revita in patients with obesity after discontinuation of GLP-1 based drugs, called REMAIN-1, is anticipated to initiate in Q3 2024.\nAbout Rejuva Fractyl Health's Rejuva\u00ae platform focuses on developing next-generation adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based, locally delivered gene therapies for the treatment of obesity and T2D. The Rejuva platform is in\npreclinical development and has not yet been evaluated by regulatory agencies for investigational or commercial use. Rejuva leverages advanced delivery systems and proprietary screening methods to identify and develop metabolically active gene therapy candidates targeting the pancreas. The program aims to transform the management of metabolic diseases by offering novel, disease-modifying therapies that address the underlying root causes of disease.\nForward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics company, today announced positive topline results from its HELIOS-B Phase 3 study of vutrisiran, an investigational RNAi therapeutic in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM).\nThe study met the primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the composite of all-cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular (CV) events during the double-blind period in both the overall population (HR 0.718, p-value 0.0118; n=654) and in the monotherapy population (patients not receiving tafamidis at baseline; HR 0.672, p-value 0.0162; n=395).\nThe study also demonstrated statistically significant improvements across all secondary endpoints in both the overall and monotherapy populations. This includes key measures of disease progression: 6-minute walk test (6-MWT), Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class at Month 30 (p<0.025 for all). Importantly, treatment with vutrisiran also reduced all-cause mortality in the overall population (HR 0.645, p<0.025) and in the monotherapy population (HR 0.655, p<0.05) up to Month 42. This was a pre-specified, intent-to-treat analysis that included up to six months of data from the open-label extension.\n\"I'm thrilled by these overwhelmingly positive data from the HELIOS-B study, which suggest that vutrisiran has the potential to address the needs of patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy, a steadily progressive, debilitating, and ultimately fatal disease,\" said Pushkal Garg, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Alnylam. \"The results showed that vutrisiran improved cardiovascular outcomes, including survival, function and quality of life in all patient groups with ATTR cardiomyopathy. We are moving with urgency to file these compelling data with regulators to bring this medicine to patients around the world.\"\nIn addition, vutrisiran demonstrated consistent effects on the primary composite endpoint and all secondary endpoints across all key subgroups, including baseline tafamidis use, ATTR disease type and measures of disease severity.\nIn the HELIOS-B study, vutrisiran demonstrated encouraging safety and tolerability, consistent with its established profile. Rates of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation were similar between the vutrisiran and placebo arms. No AEs were seen \u22653% more frequently in the vutrisiran arm compared to the placebo arm.\n\"I am overjoyed by the results of the HELIOS-B study, which suggest the potential for vutrisiran to be a transformative medicine for patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy,\" said Yvonne Greenstreet, MBChB, Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam. \"Assuming favorable regulatory review, vutrisiran has the potential to become the new standard of care for the treatment of this disease, driving Alnylam's next era of substantial growth.\"\nHELIOS-B (NCT: NCT04153149) is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter global study designed and powered to evaluate the efficacy and safety of vutrisiran on the reduction of all-cause mortality and recurrent cardiovascular events as a primary composite endpoint in patients with ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy in the overall and monotherapy populations. The study randomized 655 adult patients with ATTR amyloidosis (hereditary or wild-type) with cardiomyopathy. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive vutrisiran 25mg or placebo subcutaneously once every three months during a double-blind treatment period of up to 36 months. After the double-blind period, all eligible patients remaining on the study may receive vutrisiran in an open-label extension period.\nDetailed results from the HELIOS-B study have been submitted as a late-breaking abstract to the European Society of Cardiology for presentation. The Company plans to proceed with global regulatory submissions starting later this year, including filing a supplemental New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration using a Priority Review Voucher.\nInvestor Webcast Information\nManagement will discuss the HELIOS-B topline results via conference call on Monday, June 24, 2024, at 8:00 am ET.

Supplementation at the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of vitamin A is advised for patients taking AMVUTTRA. Higher doses than the RDA should not be given to try to achieve normal serum vitamin A levels during treatment with AMVUTTRA, as serum vitamin A levels do not reflect the total vitamin A in the body.\nPatients should be referred to an ophthalmologist if they develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency (e.g., night blindness).\nAdverse Reactions\nThe most common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with AMVUTTRA for polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR-PN) were arthralgia (11%), dyspnea (7%), and vitamin A decreased (7%).\nFor additional information about AMVUTTRA, please see the full Prescribing Information.\nAbout ATTR\nTransthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) is an underdiagnosed, rapidly progressive, debilitating and fatal disease caused by misfolded transthyretin (TTR) proteins, which accumulate as amyloid deposits in various parts of the body, including the nerves, heart and gastrointestinal tract. Patients may present with polyneuropathy, cardiomyopathy, or both manifestations of disease. There are two different forms of ATTR \u2013 hereditary ATTR (hATTR), which is caused by a TTR gene variant and affects approximately 50,000 people worldwide, and wild-type ATTR (wtATTR), which occurs without a TTR gene variant and impacts an estimated 200,000 \u2013 300,000 people worldwide.\nAbout AMVUTTRA\u00ae (vutrisiran)\nAMVUTTRA\u00ae (vutrisiran) is an RNAi therapeutic that delivers rapid knockdown of mutant and wild\u2011type transthyretin (TTR), addressing the underlying cause of transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis. Administered quarterly via subcutaneous injection, AMVUTTRA is approved and marketed in more than 15 countries for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis (hATTR-PN) in adults. Vutrisiran is also in development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM), which encompasses both wild-type and hereditary forms of the disease. For more information about AMVUTTRA, including the full U.S. Prescribing Information, visit AMVUTTRA.com.\nAbout RNAi\nRNAi (RNA interference) is a natural cellular process of gene silencing that represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug development today. Its discovery has been heralded as \"a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so,\" and was recognized with the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells, a new class of medicines known as RNAi therapeutics is now a reality. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, function upstream of today's medicines by potently silencing messenger RNA (mRNA) \u2013 the genetic precursors that encode for disease-causing or disease pathway proteins \u2013 thus preventing them from being made. This is a revolutionary approach with the potential to transform the care of patients with genetic and other diseases.\nAbout Alnylam Pharmaceuticals\nAlnylam (Nasdaq: ALNY) has led the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of people afflicted with rare and prevalent diseases with unmet need. Based on Nobel Prize-winning science, RNAi therapeutics represent a powerful, clinically validated approach yielding transformative medicines.
